[![Compiler checks](https://github.com/matteopolak/jai/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matteopolak/jai/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An independent toolchain for the [Jai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_(programming_language)) programming language:

- `jaic`, a compiler that type-checks, interprets and natively builds real Jai programs and libraries, with its own standard library;
- `jailsp`, a language server;
- `jaifmt`, a formatter;
- `jailint`, a linter.

It is written from public documentation and third-party Jai code, without access to the official compiler or its modules.

The compiler, language server and formatter also run in the browser through WebAssembly, and the language server shows jailint's findings there too.

## Install

Each install includes `jaic`, `jailsp`, `jailint`, `jaifmt` and the standard library.

**macOS (Apple silicon) and Linux (x86-64)**, with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install matteopolak/tap/jai
```

or with the install script, which verifies the download and installs into `~/.local`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteopolak/jai/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (x86-64 and arm64)**, with winget:

```sh
winget install matteopolak.jai
```

or with the PowerShell install script:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteopolak/jai/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Nix:**

```sh
nix profile install github:matteopolak/jai
```

Prebuilt archives for every platform are also on the [releases page](https://github.com/matteopolak/jai/releases) ([changelog](CHANGELOG.md)): unpack one anywhere and put `jaic` on your `PATH`, directly or through a symlink. See [package managers](docs/tools/package-managers.md) for details.

To build from source you need [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (it picks up the pinned toolchain) and, for native builds, LLVM 23 with Clang ([setup guide](docs/tools/llvm-setup.md)):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matteopolak/jai.git
cd jai
cargo build -p jaic-cli -p jai-language-server -p jailint --release --locked
```

## Usage

```jai
Node :: struct(T: Type) {
    next: *Node(T);
    value: T = 19;
}

answer :: () -> int { return 23; }

main :: () -> int {
    node: Node(int);
    return node.value + #run answer(); // Exit status: 42
}
```

```sh
jaic check examples/compile-time-record.jai        # type-check only
jaic run examples/compile-time-record.jai          # run in the interpreter
jaic build examples/compile-time-record.jai -O2    # native executable (-os windows to cross-build)
jaic check broken.jai --color always               # force coloured errors (or NO_COLOR=1 to turn them off)
jaic run examples/tour/main.jai                    # the language tour the playground opens with
jailint src/                                       # lint every .jai file under src/
jailint src/ --fix                                 # apply the safe fixes
```

## Editors

[![VS Code Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS%20Code%20Marketplace-matteopolak.jai-007ACC?logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matteopolak.jai)
[![Open VSX](https://img.shields.io/open-vsx/v/matteopolak/jai?label=Open%20VSX)](https://open-vsx.org/extension/matteopolak/jai)

The Jai extension for VS Code (and VSCodium, Cursor and other Open VSX editors) brings highlighting, the `jailsp` language server, jailint's findings and fixes, `jaifmt` formatting and *Run/Build/Check File* commands. Install it from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matteopolak.jai) or [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/matteopolak/jai); it uses the toolchain on your `PATH`, or offers to download it.

Other editors can start `jailsp` (the Language Server Protocol over stdio) and run `jaifmt --stdin` as the formatter. See [the VS Code extension](docs/tools/vscode-extension.md) and [the language server](docs/compiler/language-server.md).

## What works

**The language.** The whole core language: types, procedures, structs, enums, unions, `using`, `defer`, `context`, `Any`, polymorphism and baking, `#modify`, macros, `#code`/`#insert`, custom `for_expansion`, `#asm` (SSE through AVX2, FMA, AES, SHA, F16C, GFNI and the common AVX-512 instructions with mask registers, run on any CPU), SIMD, and runtime checks for arithmetic overflow, bounds, narrowing casts and `#complete` switches. All 56 of the reference `how_to` programs run.

**Compile-time execution.** `#run` and `jaic run` use an IR interpreter that calls into C libraries, and C can call back into Jai through procedure pointers passed as arguments or stored in memory, even from threads C starts itself. A crash inside C code names the foreign procedure and the Jai call stack. Metaprograms get the full `Compiler` module: workspaces, the message loop and build options.

**Errors** show the code around the problem with labels, notes and suggested fixes, in colour with box drawing when the terminal supports it ([diagnostics](docs/compiler/diagnostics.md)).

**Native executables** through LLVM, with debug information (DWARF on macOS and Linux):

| | x86-64 | arm64 |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| macOS | ✅ | ✅ |
| Linux | ✅ | ✅ |
| Windows | ✅ | ✅ |

**WebAssembly modules** (wasm64): `jaic build -os wasm` writes a WASI command that runs under node 24, wasmtime or a Memory64 browser, and a metaprogram can target it with `os_target = .WASM` ([wasm target](docs/native/wasm-target.md)).

On macOS and Linux, `jaic build -sanitize address,undefined` adds AddressSanitizer and LLVM's bounds checks ([sanitizers](docs/native/sanitizers.md)); CI runs the test programs that way.

**Standard library.** An independently written `stdlib/` covering the modules real programs use (Basic, String, Hash_Table, File, Thread, Process, Compiler, Simp, GetRect, Sound_Player, Iprof and more), plus `Bindings_Generator` for C, C++ (including virtual bases) and Objective-C (including block literals). A [WebGPU](docs/stdlib/webgpu.md) module covers the whole `webgpu.h` API: the same program draws in a window on macOS, Linux and Windows (wgpu-native, shipped in the release archives) and in the playground's Render pane in browsers with WebGPU and JSPI.

**Tools.**
- A [language server](docs/compiler/language-server.md) (`jailsp`) with diagnostics, type-checked hover and completion, go to definition (including `#import`/`#load` targets), find references and rename, signature help, semantic tokens, inlay hints, format-string checks, and hovers and documents showing what macros, `#insert`, `#run` and `#if` expanded to ([feature list](docs/compiler/language-server.md#feature-list)).
- A [formatter](docs/tools/jaifmt.md) (`jaifmt`) that runs natively and in the browser, either interpreted or compiled to a 214 KB `jaifmt.wasm`. Its output is canonical and idempotent: formatting twice changes nothing.
- A [linter](docs/tools/jailint.md) (`jailint`) with rules that run on the type-checked program: unused variables, parameters and imports, loops that only index (`for i: 0..xs.count-1`), hand-kept counters, redundant casts, `x == true`, format strings with the wrong number of arguments, a shadowed `it`, a `defer` in a loop, likely bugs (`u >= 0` on an unsigned value, `1 << n - 1`, `for i: 0..xs.count` indexing `xs[i]`, identical branches or operands, a `while` whose condition nothing changes, `trim(s);` with the result dropped) and unidiomatic code (`x = x + 1`, `if c return true; else return false;`), and constants that silently wrap to a narrower operand type, and opt-in checks for exact float comparison and narrowing `xx`. It applies fixes with `--fix`, reads `jailint.toml`, honours `// jailint: allow(rule)`, and its findings and fixes also show up in editors through `jailsp`.
- A [browser build](docs/browser/playground.md) of the compiler and language server, used by the [online playground](https://matteopolak.com/playground/jai), which opens with a [multi-file tour of the language](examples/tour/tour.md) (`examples/tour`).

**Real projects** such as the Focus editor, the Jails language server, jaison, jai-xml, sgpu and the programs from *The Way to Jai* compile and run; see [the full list](docs/tools/upstream-corpus.md#project-status).

## Performance

Compile times for real projects, from a release `jaic` on an Apple M5 (LLVM 23, median of warm runs):

| Project | Lines of Jai | Type-check | Debug build | Release build |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| [Focus](https://github.com/focus-editor/focus) (text editor) | 49k + 79k in modules | 1.7 s | 2.3 s | 15 s |
| [chess-jai](https://github.com/danieltan1517/chess-jai) | 10k | 0.66 s | 2.0 s | 4.9 s |
| [Jails](https://github.com/SogoCZE/Jails) (language server) | 5.6k | 0.22 s | 0.43 s | 2.2 s |
| [jaison](https://github.com/rluba/jaison) (tests) | 2.2k | 0.04 s | 0.17 s | 0.81 s |

Release builds spend most of their time in LLVM's optimiser. The formatter compiled to WebAssembly formats a 330-line file in about 1 ms. Method and full results: [compile-time benchmark](docs/tools/compile-time-benchmark.md), [latest numbers](benchmarks/results/compile-time-apple-m5.md).

## What is missing

- C's 16-byte `long double` (x86-64, arm64 Linux) is available only through jaic's non-standard [`Long_Double` extension](docs/language/long-double.md); C variadic calls cannot pass it, and in `jaic run` C cannot call back into Jai code that takes one.
- WebAssembly builds are wasm64 only, have no threads, processes or sockets, see only the directories their runtime pre-opens, and can call only the common part of libm (`sin`, `pow`, `fmod` and the like, not `sinh` or `cbrt`).

Anything unsupported fails with a compile error rather than being silently accepted.
