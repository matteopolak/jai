# Jai, in Rust

[![Compiler checks](https://github.com/matteopolak/jai/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matteopolak/jai/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An independent Jai compiler written in Rust. The goal is to compile existing Jai programs and libraries, with a clean implementation that is easy to test, understand, and improve.

**In development:** the compiler runs a growing set of Jai programs, including records, generics and compile-time code. Full standard-library and larger-project builds are still pending.

```jai
sum_to :: (n: int) -> int {
    total := 0;
    while n > 0 {
        total += n;
        n -= 1;
    }
    return total;
}

main :: () -> int {
    return sum_to(9); // Exit status: 45
}
```

## What works today

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Numbers and Booleans | Integer widths, floating point, casts and comparisons tested |
| Strings, arrays and pointers | VM and native tests; descriptor copies, iteration and pointer operations |
| Records, unions and enums | Nominal types, defaults, copies, packed layouts and static pointer data tested |
| Procedures | Named/default arguments, multiple results, callbacks and recursion tested |
| Generics and overloads | Procedure and record specialization tested; remaining forms need coverage |
| Context and `Any` | Context overrides, variadic forwarding and value boxing tested |
| Control flow | Conditions, cases, loops, named exits and lexical `defer` tested |
| Modules | Loads, scoped imports, visibility and scalar/enum/type parameters tested; advanced parameters in progress |
| Compile-time code | Source `#run`, reflection and code insertion tested; broader metaprogramming in progress |
| Compiler APIs | Workspace scheduling and selected CLI artifacts tested; broader API integration in progress |
| Foreign calls and native builds | LLVM library backend; host ABI tests and selected system-library calls |
| Debugging | Line tables, locals, records and recursive pointers tested |
| Compiler bootstrap | Independently authored source prelude type-checks; runtime integration in progress |
| Independent standard library | Authored modules included; full compilation and behavior testing pending |
| Reference examples | Source checks in progress; complete coverage pending |
| Focus, Jails, jaison, and other recent projects | Source checks only; full builds pending |
| Windows, mobile, WebAssembly | C ABI and object tests; runtime compatibility unverified |

The compatibility corpus contains **702 local reference files** and **1,440 files from seven recent upstream projects**. The latest recorded compiler parses **1,759 files** and checks **100 support files** with the included Preload. A separate feature snapshot passes all **36 positive contracts** through native execution, with **10 expected rejections** also passing. Full library and project builds remain pending. The table describes tested features in the working tree; [compatibility coverage](docs/reference-compatibility.md) explains the remaining work.

For example, record specialization and compile-time execution can work together:

```jai
Node :: struct(T: Type) {
    next: *Node(T);
    value: T = 19;
}

answer :: () -> int { return 23; }

main :: () -> int {
    node: Node(int);
    return node.value + #run answer(); // Exit status: 42
}
```

This example is included as [compile-time-record.jai](examples/compile-time-record.jai).

An independently authored standard library is included in [`stdlib/`](stdlib/). Its [coverage report](docs/stdlib/api-coverage.md) records implemented APIs, source checks, and the remaining work.

## Try it

You need [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/), Python 3.11 or newer, and an independently installed LLVM 22 with Clang. Rustup uses this repository's pinned toolchain automatically.

On macOS, install LLVM with Homebrew and set `LLVM_SYS_221_PREFIX` to its installation directory. See the [LLVM setup guide](docs/llvm-backend.md) for exact commands and troubleshooting.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matteopolak/jai.git
cd jai

# Check dependency release dates before building.
python3 tools/check_dependency_age.py
cargo build -p jai-cli --locked
```

The example above is included as `examples/sum.jai`:

```sh
cargo run -p jai-cli -- check examples/sum.jai
cargo run -p jai-cli -- build examples/sum.jai sum
./sum
echo $? # 45
```

You can inspect tokens with `lex`, check one file's syntax with `parse`, or save its LLVM output with `emit-llvm`:

```sh
cargo run -p jai-cli -- emit-llvm examples/sum.jai sum.ll
```

## Compatibility and performance

The local Jai distribution helps establish language behavior. Newer, maintained Jai projects guide compatibility when they differ from that older reference. The [upstream corpus](docs/upstream-corpus.md) records the projects and exact revisions used.

Tests cover rejected programs and the behavior of newly compiled programs. Benchmarks measure compiler time and Rust allocations so performance work can be based on measurements. Unsupported features produce errors instead of counting as successful builds.

The compiler uses an independently authored [source prelude](docs/compiler-prelude.md) split into protocol components under `prelude/`. Supplied source distributions remain external compatibility inputs. The retired reference probe used an authorized compiler asset for isolated static inspection and bounded developer-help experiments; [binary inspection](docs/binary-inspection.md) preserves those findings and their limits.

## Working on the compiler

For a public checkout:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --locked -- \
  --skip lex_entire_reference_without_executing_it
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo bench -p jai-bench --bench compiler --locked -- --test --skip reference_lex
cargo bench -p jai-bench --bench vm --locked -- --test
```

The skipped lexer test requires the separately supplied reference files. Native-path rejection tests run in public checkouts too. Local reference checks run without the lexer filter.

Start with the [developer guide](docs/README.md) for architecture, language coverage, benchmarks, and dependency policy. Rustfmt keeps code formatting consistent, and Cargo enforces a minimum dependency release age of 14 days.
