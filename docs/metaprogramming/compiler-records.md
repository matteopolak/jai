# Compiler records (messages, syntax trees, type descriptors)

## What it is

The bridge that lets a metaprogram see another workspace's code: `Message_File`, `Message_Import`, `Message_Typechecked`, the `Code_*` nodes, the target program's `Type_Info_*` descriptors, and `compiler_get_nodes`, `compiler_get_code` and `compiler_modify_procedure`.

## How it works

### Why records

A metaprogram runs in its own compiler's interpreter, which borrows that compiler, and the target workspace's types are not the metaprogram's types. So the target's compiler exports neutral records (`crates/jaic/src/records.rs`): a tag naming a Jai struct (`"Code_Ident"`, `"Type_Info_Struct"`, `"Message_Import"`) and named fields, each an `Int` (floats as bits), `Str`, `Ref` (record id, 0 = null) or a list of those. Ids are global to the compilation, and records live until it ends.

### Rust exporter

`sema/code_export.rs`, with state in `Compiler::export`:

- `export_file_events`: an IMPORT record per module before its first file, and a FILE record per file. Module types: Preload is `PRELOAD`, Runtime_Support `RUNTIME_SUPPORT`, the main module `MAIN_PROGRAM`, the rest `UNINITIALIZED`. Hidden `__module`/`__file` fields let `add_build_string(.., message)` find the module.
- `export_typechecked`: every new top-level declaration of a user module is resolved and exported with its type. User means not Preload or Runtime_Support and not under the system module directory (the directory of `Runtime_Support.jai`). Procedure headers, bodies and struct literals inside go into `procedure_headers`, `procedure_bodies` and `structs`, and every node into `subexpressions`. Declarations that fail to resolve are skipped, where the official compiler would report an error.
- Global declarations, parameters and returns, and type instantiations get `type`; local declarations and other expressions don't. Notes after a procedure body attach to the declaration and the header. `Code_Node.serial` is the record id.
- `type_record` makes Type_Info records, memoised per `TypeId`. Primitive types carry `__builtin` (their name) so the metaprogram substitutes its own descriptor and `decl.type == type_info(int)` works. Polymorphic struct instances get `specified_parameters`, `constant_storage` and a generic `polymorph_source_struct`; `Type` parameters are pointers the Jai side patches from `__constant_pointers`.
- A top-level enum's `Code_Enum.external_type` is its `Type_Info_Enum`.
- `-1` and `-1.5` export as one negative `Code_Literal`, as the official compiler folds them (yield-jai overwrites `_s64` of `#code case -1`).
- Backticked identifiers and declarations set `HAS_SCOPE_MODIFIER`. `#assert` and `#run` statements export as `Code_Directive_Run` (with jaic's extra `expression` and `message`), `#exists(x)` as `Code_Directive_Exists`.
- `a, b := f()` is a `Code_Compound_Declaration`: the names in `comma_separated_assignment`, the shared type and values in a nameless `declaration_properties`.

`build::step` takes the record table out of the registry while exporting (resolving can run compile-time code) and queues IMPORT, FILE and TYPECHECKED events whose int 0 is the message record.

### Procedures in TYPECHECKED

A procedure whose body isn't lowered yet is reported with a null `body_or_null` and queued in `ExportState::pending_bodies`. Each later `export_typechecked` reports the bodies lowered since, with local declaration types, and patches the header's `body_or_null`. The Jai side also patches the cached header struct, since a metaprogram may still hold it from the earlier message (MetaThreadSafe checks bodies at COMPLETE). Bodies nothing reaches are never lowered, so their errors never surface, matching the official compiler.

Exception: noted procedures (`@glsl`, `@thread`, on the header or after the body) whose headers went out are lowered leniently once the workspace runs out of sources (`lower_reachable_inner`), because metaprograms find shaders and checked procedures by note whether or not anything calls them (Jai-Shader-Transpiler). Only procedures in the main module qualify. Imported modules ship stale noted procedures: Vk-Engine's `@PrintLike FormatToCString` calls a procedure that doesn't exist.

`ExportState::resolved_headers` keeps one header record per procedure, shared by `resolved_procedure_expression` and the reported header, so a checker following calls reaches bodies. The key includes `Exporter::own`: a compiler's own compile-time code (`#modify`) needs type records with real descriptors, which exports for a metaprogram don't have. Resolved headers carry the procedure's notes, including those after the body (`Compiler::proc_decl_notes`, copied to polymorph instances), and list `using` parameters in `parameter_usings`.

### Phases

When a workspace runs out of sources, `step` lowers everything reachable (`Compiler::lower_reachable`, lenient: a failing body stays queued). If that reports new declarations or bodies (a body can declare more through `#insert,scope(...)`), the metaprogram gets another `TYPECHECKED_ALL_WE_CAN` and may add code. Only a round that reports nothing new proceeds to `finish_program` and code generation.

### Jai side

`stdlib/Compiler/records.jai`: `record_struct(id, expected)` allocates the struct the tag names (`RECORD_TYPES`, else the expected pointee type), zero-fills it, and fills members by name through `Type_Info_Struct`: integers, enums, bools and floats by size, strings, pointers (recursively and memoised, so a record maps to one pointer forever), in-place structs, and arrays of those. `using` members and anonymous unions are filled from the same record. `record_of(pointer)` maps back. Every `Code_*` struct sets its own kind (`base.kind = .IDENT;`), so nodes a metaprogram makes with `New(Code_Ident)` behave like exported ones.

Large metaprograms build hundreds of thousands of records, so filling is split:

- `record_plan(info)` flattens a struct type's members once, cached per `Type_Info_Struct`.
- `__jaic_rec_fill` writes ints, strings and pointers to already-built records in one native call and returns a bit mask of members Jai must still fill (arrays, in-place structs, records not built yet). `__jaic_rec_fill_list` does the same for array elements. `__jaic_rec_tag_id` numbers tags so `record_type_of` can cache the struct type.
- Structs come from 256 KiB zeroed chunks (`record_memory`) and are never freed, like the official compiler's nodes. Array data is allocated separately because metaprograms grow those arrays with `array_add`.
- The pointer-to-record index behind `record_of` is built on its first call.
- Strings point into the records' own `Rc<[u8]>`, kept alive in `Workspaces::kept`.

### `compiler_get_nodes` and typed nodes

`Compiler::add_code` mirrors every `Code` value (AST plus source snippet) into `Interp::codes`. `__jaic_code_nodes` exports it, storing the snippet as `__source` on the root; the Jai side remembers each (root, code) pair in `__code_roots`.

Libraries like or_return, MetaThreadSafe and Jai-Shader-Transpiler read `Code_Procedure_Call.resolved_procedure_expression`, `Code_Ident.resolved_declaration` and `Code_Node.type`. Those need the compiler, which a `MetaOp` can't reach while the interpreter runs. So jaic traps and reruns:

1. `call_thunk` (`sema/consteval.rs`) counts the run's observable effects (`Interp::effects`: output, foreign calls other than memory and string helpers, workspace operations).
2. While nothing observable has happened yet, `__jaic_code_nodes` traps with `Interp::export_request`.
3. `call_thunk` exports the code with the compiler (`export_code_typed`, then `export_code_in`) into `Interp::code_exports` and reruns the thunk from the start.

A run that already did something observable gets untyped nodes. Each `compiler_get_nodes` call takes its own export (`code_export_cursor` resets every run), so in-place edits never leak into another call.

Gotcha: a run that writes globals before `compiler_get_nodes` writes them again on the rerun; only I/O and foreign calls count as effects.

In typed exports:

- Names resolve to locals first (`Exporter::locals`, scoped per block), then `Compiler::lookup` from the code's scope. A declaration resolves to a cached reference record (`resolved_decls`) with `type`, `type_inst.result` and, for procedures, a header as `expression`. Builtins like `size_of` resolve to nothing.
- Calls pick the only candidate, else the first overload whose parameter count fits.
- Value expressions get `type` by checking them in the code's scope without emitting (`Exporter::expr_type`); untyped literals report their default (`s64`, `float64`).
- Type records carry `__address`, the real descriptor in this program's memory, so `type == type_info(T)` works.
- In `x := value`, the value takes the declaration's type when it has none.

### On-demand lowering

A compile-time run inside another body's lowering (`lowering_depth > 0`, such as a `#modify` or a `#run` in a macro) must not drain every queued body, since one of them may be the procedure being lowered. `lower_reachable_from(thunk)` lowers only the bodies the thunk's IR reaches (calls, function addresses, globals' relocations). A call that still reaches a bodiless function traps with `Interp::missing_func`; `call_thunk` lowers it (`lower_with_callees`) and reruns, under the same no-effects rule.

### `compiler_get_code`

Prints the node tree with `Program_Print` and passes the text to `__jaic_parse_code`, which parses it (`build::parse_code_text`) into a new `Interp::codes` entry and records in `Interp::made_codes` whose scope it takes (`code_to_copy_scope_from`). The compiler adopts such codes (`Compiler::adopt_made_codes`) when it reads a `Code` back or adds one of its own, re-parsing the text as a registered source so diagnostics can point into it. Node edits the printer can't express are lost (see [Program_Print](../stdlib/program-print.md)).

Without `code_to_copy_scope_from` the code is unscoped (`Compiler::unscoped_codes`) and resolves at the insertion site, as in the official compiler; yield-jai builds `(self: *COROUTINE) -> ...` where only the inserting macro knows `COROUTINE`. Names the site lacks fall back to the scopes of codes handed to `compiler_get_nodes` (newest first, `Interp::nodes_codes`), because official nodes keep what they resolved to where they were written: Epic_Fail's `#code` blocks call `print_to_builder`, which the inserting user never imported. `Compiler::code_scope_at` makes a block scope under the site with `Scope::fallbacks`, and `lookup_full` consults fallbacks only when nothing else binds a name.

### `compiler_modify_procedure`

For each statement of `body.block.statements`, Jai sends the record id, or 0 plus the `Program_Print` text when the statement is new or was edited anywhere below. `record_differs` in `records.jai` compares every member with what `fill_struct` wrote, following `Code_*` pointers but not `resolved_*` or `type`, and skipping union members that overlap a present field.

The edit is queued and applied at the workspace's next step (`Compiler::modify_procedure`): unchanged statements map back to their AST, `#code` roots are re-parsed from `__source`, edited ones from their text, inside a dummy procedure. The `ProcLit` is replaced, and if the body was already lowered it is lowered again into the same function once the registry borrow is released (`relower_modified`).

## How to change it

- New node kind: a case in `Exporter::expr`/`stmt` building a record with the `Code_*` member names, and an entry in `RECORD_TYPES` if it is reached through a base pointer.
- New field: add it to the record. The Jai filler matches by name, ignores unknown names and leaves missing fields zero. Keep names identical to `stdlib/Compiler/nodes.jai` and `prelude/reflection.jai`.
- Only top-level statement lists can be modified; nested blocks would need their statement records mapped too.
- Gotcha: anything the exporter resolves can run compile-time code, so never hold the registry borrow.

Tests: `tests/stdlib/compiler-typechecked-messages.jai`, `compiler-resolved-nodes.jai`, `compiler-get-code.jai`, `compiler-noted-module-procs.jai`, `compiler-header-own-types.jai`.

## Configuration

None. Exports happen only for intercepted workspaces.

## Dependencies
