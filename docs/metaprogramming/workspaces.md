# Workspaces and metaprograms

## What it is

The Rust side of the `Compiler` module, in `crates/jaic/src/build.rs`. Metaprograms (`build.jai`, `first.jai`) create workspaces, add files and strings, set build options and read compiler messages through `#compiler` primitives; the Jai API on top of them is in [Compiler module](compiler-module.md).

## How it works

### Registry

The embedder creates `Workspaces` (shared as `SharedWorkspaces`, an `Rc<RefCell<..>>`) with a `BuildEnv`: file system, base `Options`, an optional `OutputBackend`, command-line args after `-`, a host factory, a report sink, and an optional `WorkspaceObserver` that sees each workspace's compiler when it is made and gets it back when the workspace is done ([jailint](../tools/jailint.md) uses it to lint what a metaprogram builds). `Compiler::attach_workspaces` gives the compile-time interpreter access.

Workspace 2 is the top-level program (`TOP_LEVEL_WORKSPACE`). Workspace 1 is reserved, as in the official compiler, so the first workspace a metaprogram creates is 3.

### Primitives

Bodiless `#compiler` procedures named `__jaic_*` are bound to `Hook::Meta(MetaOp, has_context)` in `proc_func` (`sema/procs.rs`); `interp::run_hook` forwards them to `build::call`. The ABI is: optional context pointer, the parameters (memory types such as `string` by address), then out-addresses for memory-typed results.

| Primitive | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `__jaic_workspace_create(name) -> s64` | new workspace id |
| `__jaic_current_workspace() -> s64` | workspace whose compile-time code is running |
| `__jaic_workspace_add_file/add_string(ws, s)` | queue a source (`ProgramSource`) |
| `__jaic_workspace_set_option(ws, key, value)` | set a build option by name |
| `__jaic_workspace_begin_intercept(ws)` | mark intercepted |
| `__jaic_workspace_next_event(ws) -> s64` | advance the workspace if needed, pop the next event kind (0 = none) |
| `__jaic_event_int(i)`, `__jaic_event_string(i)` | fields of the current event |
| `__jaic_command_line_count/arg(i)` | metaprogram arguments |
| `__jaic_report(msg, file, line, col, is_error)` | errors fail the compile; warnings go to the report sink |
| `__jaic_compiler_version()`, `__jaic_custom_link_complete(ws, code)` | |

The `__jaic_rec_*`, `__jaic_code_nodes`, `__jaic_parse_code` and `__jaic_modify_procedure` primitives belong to [compiler records](compiler-records.md).

### Workspace state machine

`build::step` advances a workspace whenever its events are read, or from `build::finish_all` after the top-level compile for workspaces nobody intercepted. `finish_all` skips a workspace that never got a file or string: there is nothing to compile, and building it would link an executable without `main`. Its `Compiler` lives in the registry between steps.

1. **Open to Checked**: `Compiler::begin_sources` loads the bootstrap and queued sources and runs their `#run`s. Events: FILE..., PHASE `ALL_SOURCE_CODE_PARSED`, PHASE `TYPECHECKED_ALL_WE_CAN`.
2. **Checked with new sources** (the metaprogram called `add_build_string` after `TYPECHECKED_ALL_WE_CAN`): `add_source` and `settle`, new FILE events, `TYPECHECKED_ALL_WE_CAN` again.
3. **Checked to Done**: `finish_program` lowers, output is written, COMPLETE.

The registry borrow is released while a compiler runs, so nested metaprograms work. Sources a `#run` adds to its own workspace (`add_build_string(s, -1)`, for example to define a `#placeholder`) are pulled by `Compiler::pull_workspace_sources` right after that `#run`; `run_top_level` is incremental. `compiler_modify_procedure` calls are queued and applied at the start of the next `step`, so bodies are replaced before they are lowered.

### Events

| Kind | Payload |
|---|---|
| `IMPORT` (4) | int 0 = record; sent before a module's first file |
| `FILE` (1) | int 0 = record; one per loaded file |
| `TYPECHECKED` (5) | int 0 = record; just before PHASE `TYPECHECKED_ALL_WE_CAN` |
| `PHASE` (2) | int 0 = phase: 0 `ALL_SOURCE_CODE_PARSED`, 1 `TYPECHECKED_ALL_WE_CAN`, 2 `ALL_TARGET_CODE_BUILT`, 3 `PRE_WRITE_EXECUTABLE` (int 1 = object count `n`, strings = objects then output path), 4 `POST_WRITE_EXECUTABLE` (string 0 = output path) |
| `COMPLETE` (3) | int 0 = error code (0 none, 1 failed) |

IMPORT, FILE and TYPECHECKED are only produced for intercepted workspaces.

### Output

When `do_output` is set and `output_type != NO_OUTPUT`, the embedder's `OutputBackend::write_output` gets the IR program and `BuildSettings` (path `output_path/output_executable_name`). `jaic build` passes an LLVM backend (object file, `cc` link, `-shared` for `DYNAMIC_LIBRARY`, `ar` for `STATIC_LIBRARY`); `jaic run`, `jaic check` and the browser pass none, so workspaces are only checked.

Workspace 2's own settings decide whether `jaic build` writes the top-level program, so a metaprogram calling `set_build_options_dc(.{do_output = false})` produces no output of its own.

## How to change it

- New primitive: a `MetaOp` variant and name in `MetaOp::from_name`, a case in `build::call`, and a bodiless `#compiler` declaration in `stdlib/Compiler`.
- New option: handle the key in `Workspaces::set_option` and read it where the compiler is created (`new_compiler`) or output is written (`write_output`).
- New event kind: push it in `step`. Strings handed to Jai must go through `keep_string` so they outlive the call; structured payloads should be records (`crate::records`).
- Gotcha: never hold `shared.borrow_mut()` across `compile_sources` or a backend call; both can re-enter.

## Configuration

Option keys handled by `set_option`: `output_executable_name`, `output_path`, `output_type`, `do_output`, `import_path_clear`, `import_path`, `os_target`, `cpu_target` (targets jaic can't build for are ignored), `optimization`, `temporary_storage_size`, `additional_linker_arguments_clear`, `additional_linker_argument`, `array_bounds_check`, `arithmetic_overflow_check`, `stack_trace`, `emit_debug_info`. Other keys are accepted and ignored. `arithmetic_overflow_check` applies to workspaces a metaprogram creates, not the program's own.

`jaic build build.jai - arg1 arg2` passes `arg1 arg2` to the metaprogram.

## Dependencies

`sema::Compiler` (`compile_sources`, `ProgramSource`), interpreter hooks, `jaic-llvm` (the CLI's backend), `stdlib/Compiler`.
