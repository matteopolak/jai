# Stack traces (`context.stack_trace`)

## What it is

While a program runs under `jaic run`, `context.stack_trace` points at a linked list of
`Stack_Trace_Node`s, innermost procedure first, as in `jai`. `print_stack_trace`, assertion
failures and the memory debugger's leak reports read it.

## How it works

- At lowering (`sema/procs.rs`, `lower_body_code`) every procedure that takes a context, and is
  not `inline` or `#no_debug`, gets `Func.trace = Some(TraceInfo { name, file, line, col })`.
- `Interp::exec` (`interp/mod.rs`) pushes a node when such a function is entered. The node lives in
  the callee's interpreter stack frame (32 bytes after the frame). Its fields: `next` (the
  previous top), `info` (a leaked `Stack_Trace_Procedure_Info` cached per `FuncId`), `hash`,
  `call_depth` (previous + 1, first node 1) and `line_number`.
- The caller's node `line_number` is the line of the call being made: on entry the callee writes
  the interpreter's current source location (`Inst::Loc`) into `previous.line_number`. A fresh
  node starts with the procedure's declaration line.
- On return `context.stack_trace` is restored to `next`. `exec` also restores `self.loc` so a
  statement with several calls reports the right line for each.
- `Program.stack_trace_offset` (byte offset of `stack_trace` in `#Context`) and
  `Program.file_paths` are filled by `Compiler::enable_stack_traces` in `run_program`. Nothing is
  pushed at compile time (`Interp.compile_time`), and nothing when the offset is `None`.
- `runtime_support_assertion_failed` (`stdlib/Runtime_Support.jai`) prints
  `path:line,col: Assertion failed: message` then `Stack trace:` and one `path:line: name` per
  node, in the format of `jai`.

## How to change it

- The node layout must match `Stack_Trace_Node` in `prelude/diagnostics.jai` (and the constants in
  `trace_enter`).
- Hash values are not those of `jai`; they only mix the caller hash, procedure id and call line.
- There is no sentinel node from `push_context` and leaf procedures also get nodes (jai omits
  them), so call depths can differ from the real compiler's by those cases.

## Configuration

`Build_Options.stack_trace` (default true) is read for workspaces created by a metaprogram
(`BuildSettings.stack_trace`, `Options.stack_trace`).

## Dependencies

`ir::Func::trace`, `ir::Program::{file_paths, stack_trace_offset}`, `interp::Interp::trace_enter`.
Test: `tests/stdlib/stack-trace-nodes.jai`.
