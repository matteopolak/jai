# Casts and conversions

## What it is

How a value changes type: implicit conversion, `cast(T)`, the contextual `xx`, postfix `.(T)`, and the `no_check`, `trunc` and `force` modifiers.

## How it works

`explicit_cast` in `crates/jaic/src/sema/convert.rs` handles every explicit form. `parse_cast_flags` in `parser/expr.rs` reads the modifiers into `CastFlags { no_check, truncate, force }` (`trunc` and `truncate` are synonyms).

```jai
small := cast,no_check(u8) wide;     // u16 298 -> 42
t := cast,trunc(u8) 256;             // 0
x: u8 = xx,trunc 298;                // 42, target comes from the declaration
p := (298).(u8);                     // postfix form, 42
q := big.(u32, trunc);               // postfix with a modifier
bits := cast,force(u32) f;           // float 3.7 -> 1080872141, reinterprets bits
```

The example produces the values in its comments {#cast.1}; the postfix form takes modifiers after the type {#cast.9}.

Scalar rules:

- A cast to a narrower integer type checks that the value fits (see [cast bounds checks](#cast-bounds-checks)); `cast,trunc` and `cast,no_check` keep the low bits instead: `cast,trunc(u8) w` with `w := 300` is `44` {#cast.2}. A cast to a type at least as wide is never checked: `cast(u64) n` with `n: s8 = -1` is `18446744073709551615` {#cast.4}.
- Float-to-integer truncates toward zero: `cast(s64) -3.99` is `-3` {#cast.3}.
- Integer-to-float casts round once, to nearest even, at the target width. `cast(float32)` of a 64-bit integer does not go through `float64`, which would round twice: `2^63 + 2^39 + 1` must give the `float32` above the tie. The interpreter (`conv` in `interp/mod.rs`), constant folding (`int_to_float` in `sema/convert.rs`) and LLVM (`sitofp`/`uitofp`) agree (`tests/stdlib/int-to-float32-rounding.jai`).
- `cast,force` between a same-size integer and float reinterprets the bits {#cast.5}.
- A number, enum or pointer cast to `bool` compares with zero {#cast.7}, so the result is exactly `true` or `false` (`!cast(bool) 2` is false) {#cast.22}. `cast(bool) ""` is false {#cast.6}.
- Pointers and integers convert both ways (`cast(s64) ptr`, `cast(*u8) addr`, `cast(*u8) 0 == null`) {#cast.23}. Integer constants cast to pointers fold to constants {#cast.24}.
- `pointer & int`, `pointer | int` and `pointer ^ int` are legal and keep the pointer type, because allocator code masks pointers with `cast(u64) p & MASK` {#cast.21}.
- `*void` accepts any pointer implicitly, and converts implicitly back to any pointer type (`p: *T = alloc(size_of(T));`) {#cast.8}.
- `E.loose` and `E` convert to each other implicitly {#cast.15}.
- A string literal converts to `*u8`; a `string` variable does not (see [strings and literals](strings-and-literals.md)) {#cast.25}. String literals also convert to `#type,distinct` and `#type,isa` string variants {#cast.26}, and `.[...]` literals take an expected distinct array type of the same shape {#cast.27}.

Where the target type comes from:

- `xx` takes the type the context expects: a declaration, a parameter, a return.
- In a comparison, `xx a == b` casts `a` to `b`'s type; `check_binary` checks the other side first {#cast.11}.
- As a call argument, `xx a | b` (also `&`, `^`) takes the parameter's type and the other operand follows it (`autocast_arithmetic` in `sema/calls.rs`) {#cast.12}. Arithmetic on an untyped struct literal works the same way: `f(.{300, -1} * scale)` builds the parameter's `Vector2` and then uses its `operator *` (`literal_arithmetic`) {#cast.10}.
- A cast does not push its type into its operand. `cast(T) expr` types `expr` bottom-up, exactly as it would be typed on its own, and then converts it. So with `w: u16 = 15`, `cast(float32) (0 - w)` subtracts in `u16` (the `0` is matched with `w`, see [numbers](numbers.md)) and converts `65521`, and `cast(float32) ((0 - w) & v)` is `u16` arithmetic. `cast(s32) (x + 100)` with `x: s8 = 100` adds in `s8` and wraps to `-56` before widening {#cast.29}.
- Only operands with no type of their own take the cast's type: a bare `.NAME`, an untyped `.{...}` or `.[...]`, and operators or an `ifx` built only from those (`cast(Flags) (.A | .B)`). A bare number (`cast(float32) 3`, `cast(u8) 255`) or a literal-only expression stays an untyped constant and is folded at the target: `cast(float32) (1 / 3)` is `0`, integer division first {#cast.30}.
- An expected float type from a declaration or a parameter does not reach the operands of `&`, `|`, `^` and `%`, which floats lack: `f: float32 = (ifx c then a else b) & mask;` with `s16` branches computes in `s16` and converts the result {#cast.31}.
- `ifx c then a else b` with no expected type takes the else type when only the then value converts to it (`ifx c then 0 else some_float` is a float); otherwise the then type wins {#cast.13}.
- A call whose single result has exactly the base type of an `#type,isa` argument returns the variant (`pa + pb` on `Position3` stays `Position3`; `emit_call` in `sema/calls.rs`) {#cast.28}.

### How far a prefix cast reaches

A prefix `cast(T)` or `xx` is a unary operator at `CAST_PREC`, between the bitwise operators and `*` (see [operators](operators.md)). Its operand takes postfix and bitwise/shift operators; everything looser applies to the cast's result:

| After the cast operand | Applies to | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.`, `[]`, `()`, `.*` | operand | `cast(float) p.x / 2` is `(cast(float) p.x) / 2` {#cast.16} |
| `&`, `\|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `<<<`, `>>>` | operand | `cast(float) (hex >> 16) & 0xFF` is `cast(float) ((hex >> 16) & 0xFF)` {#cast.17} |
| `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | result | `cast(*u8) p + 1` is `(cast(*u8) p) + 1` {#cast.18} |
| comparisons, `&&`, `\|\|` | result | `cast(u8) n < 300` compares a `u8` {#cast.19} |

So `cast(u32) b << 4 | 1` is `cast(u32) ((b << 4) | 1)` {#cast.20}; write `(cast(u32) b) << 16` to widen before shifting.

Why: real code only type-checks or matches its recorded output with this grouping. `cast(bool) flags & .REVERSE` and float `cast(float) (hex >> 16) & 0xFF` are errors if `&` applies to the result. open-jai's `utils/stress.jai` base64 encoder builds `(cast(u32) a << 16) | ...` from `u8`s, and its recorded output only matches if the shift happens before widening. Pointer differences like `cast(s64) p2 - cast(s64) p0 == 8` and `cast(float) width * v` (with `v` a `Vector2`) need `-` and `*` to stop. The official 0.2.005 changelog also says a cast of a sum needs parentheses.

A comma after a cast keyword is a modifier, not a list separator, so `(-cast,no_check(int) x)` parses as one expression {#cast.14}.

### Cast bounds checks

`Build_Options.cast_bounds_check` (`.FATAL` by default, `.NONFATAL`, `.OFF`) checks a runtime integer cast to a narrower integer type. A value outside the target's range stops the program:

```
cast.jai:3:5: error: runtime error: cast of 300 to `u8` overflows
        c := cast(u8) w;
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: `u8` holds 0 to 255; write `cast,trunc(u8)` (or `xx,trunc`) to keep the low bits, or `cast,no_check(u8)` to skip the check
```

A negative value does not fit an unsigned target (`cast(u16)` of `n: s32 = -1` fails). Casts to a type of the same size or wider only extend or reinterpret the bits, so `cast(s64)` of a large `u64` and `cast(u32)` of a negative `s32` are never checked {#cast.32}. Evidence: `26.22_insert_scope.jai` in The Way to Jai prints negative numbers from `cast(int) random_get() % 100`, where `random_get` returns a `u64`.

`.NONFATAL` prints `path:line: warning: cast of 300 to `u8` overflows` on stderr and goes on with the low bits; `.OFF` keeps the low bits silently. The option applies to workspaces a metaprogram creates, like the other checks {#cast.33}.

`xx` to a narrower type is checked like `cast`; `trunc`, `no_check` and `force` skip the check, and so do constants (folded at compile time), enums and pointers {#cast.34}.

## How to change it

- **Cast reach:** `parse_cast_value` in `parser/expr.rs` parses a unary operand, then calls `parse_binary_after(first, CAST_PREC)`. Move `CAST_PREC` or operators in `binary_op` to change what a cast absorbs, and update `tests/stdlib/cast-operand-precedence.jai` and the parser test `prefix_cast_takes_bitwise_and_shift_operators`.
- **Scalar conversions:** `scalar_convert`; aggregate and array cases are later branches of `explicit_cast`.
- **Implicit conversions:** priced by `implicit_cost`. Overload resolution uses that cost, so changing it changes which overload wins.
- **What a cast's operand sees:** the `E::Cast` arm of `check_expr` in `sema/expr.rs` passes the target as the operand's expected type only when `cast_operand_needs_target` says the operand has no type of its own. Widening that predicate to numbers or arithmetic would bring back the old top-down typing (`cast(float32) (0 - w)` giving `-15`).
- **Constants:** folded at the top of `explicit_cast`. Change that and the runtime path together, or `#run` and runtime results diverge.
- **Cast bounds checks:** `emit_cast_check` in `sema/convert.rs`, called from the `E::Cast` arm of `check_expr`. It compares the value with the target's range in the source type and branches to `Intrinsic::CheckFailed` (`ir::TRAP_CAST_OVERFLOW`; the detail operand is `ir::cast_check_code`). The interpreter reports it as a trap or a warning; native code calls `runtime_support_check_failed` in `stdlib/Runtime_Support.jai`. The message is `ir::check_message`, shared by both, and the help is `cast_help` in `sema/trap_report.rs`. Code that narrows on purpose should say so with `cast,trunc`.
