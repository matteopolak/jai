# Casts and conversions

## What it is

How a value changes type: implicit conversion, `cast(T)`, the contextual `xx`, postfix `.(T)`, and the `no_check`, `trunc` and `force` modifiers.

## How it works

`explicit_cast` in `crates/jaic/src/sema/convert.rs` handles every explicit form. Modifiers are parsed by `parse_cast_flags` in `crates/jaic/src/parser/expr.rs` into `CastFlags { no_check, truncate, force }` (`trunc` and `truncate` are synonyms).

```jai
small := cast,no_check(u8) wide;     // u16 298 -> 42
t := cast,trunc(u8) 256;             // 0
x: u8 = xx,trunc 298;                // 42, target comes from the declaration
p := (298).(u8);                     // postfix form, 42
bits := cast,force(u32) f;           // float 3.7 -> 1080872141, reinterprets bits
```

Observed behavior (checked with `jaic run`):

- Integer-to-integer casts wrap to the target width, with or without a modifier. `cast(u8) w` with `w := 300` gives `44`; there is no range trap.
- Float-to-integer casts truncate toward zero: `cast(s64) -3.99` is `-3`.
- `cast(u64) n` for `n: s8 = -1` gives `18446744073709551615`.
- `cast,force` between a same-size integer and float reinterprets the bits.
- `cast(bool) 5` is true, `cast(bool) ""` is false. A number, enum or pointer cast to `bool` compares with zero, so the result is exactly `true` or `false` (`tests/stdlib/cast-to-bool-nonzero.jai`).
- `*void` accepts any pointer implicitly; going back needs `cast(*T)` or `xx`.
- The postfix form takes modifiers after the type: `big.(u32, trunc)` (AST_Utils hashes `k.(*Type_Info).(u32,trunc)`).
- As a call argument, arithmetic on an untyped struct literal takes the parameter's type: `f(.{300, -1} * scale)` builds a `Vector2` and then uses its `operator *` (`literal_arithmetic` in `sema/calls.rs`, `tests/stdlib/literal-arithmetic-argument.jai`).
- In a comparison, `xx a == b` casts `a` to `b`'s type (`xx err == GL_FALSE` with `err: s32`, `GL_FALSE` a bool): the other side is checked first (`check_binary`).
- As a call argument, `xx a | b` (also `&`, `^`, and inside a macro) takes the parameter's type, and the other operand follows it (`add_piece(p, xx a1|h1)` with `enum_flags` squares): `autocast_arithmetic` defers the whole binary to the parameter (`tests/stdlib/autocast-bitwise-argument.jai`).
- `ifx c then a else b` without an expected type takes the else-type when only the then-value converts implicitly to it (`ifx c then 0 else some_float` is a float). The then-type still wins otherwise (`tests/stdlib/ifx-widens-to-else.jai`).
- `(-cast,no_check(int) x)` in parentheses is an expression; the comma after a cast keyword is a modifier, not a list separator (`tests/stdlib/cast-modifier-in-parens.jai`).
- `E.loose` and `E` convert to each other implicitly (a node's `operator_type: Operator_Type.loose` passed as `Operator_Type`).

### How far a prefix cast reaches

`cast(T) x op y` and `xx x op y` group by operator class:

| After the cast value | Grouping | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.`, `[]`, `()`, `.*` (postfix) | value | `cast(float) p.x / 2` is `(cast(float) p.x) / 2` |
| `&`, `\|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `<<<`, `>>>` | value | `cast(float) (hex >> 16) & 0xFF` is `cast(float) ((hex >> 16) & 0xFF)` |
| `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | result | `cast(*u8) p + 1` is `(cast(*u8) p) + 1` |
| `==`, `<`, ..., `&&`, `\|\|` | result | `cast(u8) n < 300` compares a `u8` |

The bitwise and shift operators keep their usual order among themselves (`cast(u32) b << 4 | 1` is `cast(u32) ((b << 4) | 1)`). Write parentheses (`(cast(u32) b) << 16`) to widen before shifting.

Evidence (no compiler was run; counts are unparenthesized `cast(T) operand OP` sites in reference/ and the pinned corpus): `*` 185, `+` 147, `-` 135, `/` 109, `<<` 72, `&` 71, `==` 37, `%` 22, `>>` 20, `^` 14, `|` 7, other comparisons 13, `&&`/`||` 6; `xx`: `+` 21, `*` 18, `&` 11, `|` 11. The sites that only type-check, or only match recorded output, one way:

- `&` takes the value: ui_builder `(cast(float) (hex >> 16) & 0xFF) / 255.0` (float `&` is an error otherwise; it runs at compile time in the demo's theme); jai-utils `cast(bool) flags & .REVERSE` (four sites, a bool `&` an enum is an error); the reference allocators' `cast(u64) p & MASK` on pointers (about 20 lines), which also needs `pointer & integer` to be legal.
- `<<` takes the value: open-jai `utils/stress.jai` base64 builds `(cast(u32) a << 16) | ...` from `u8`s, and its recorded real-Jai output (`'f'` gives `AA==`) only matches if the `u8` shift happens before widening.
- `-` stops: the same file's recorded `cast(s64) p2 - cast(s64) p0 == 8` and `cast(*u8) pb - cast(*u8) pa == 8`.
- `+` stops: the reference CHANGELOG (the 0.2.005 cast-syntax discussion) says that casting a value that involves an addition needs parentheses around that value, so a bare `cast(T) a + b` casts only `a`. The same note says `xx` has the same precedence issue.
- `*` stops: the reference `invaders` example multiplies `cast(float) width * BUTTON_POSITION` where the right side is a `Vector2`.
- `xx` behaves the same: corpus `xx (ch | byteMark) & byteMask`, `xx line_starts[0] & LINE_START_MASK`.

Because of this, `pointer & int`, `pointer | int` and `pointer ^ int` are defined and keep the pointer's type, and `cast(bool)` of a number, enum or pointer is a real non-zero test (`!cast(bool) 2` is false).

Real Jai's binary table also differs from ours elsewhere (its recorded output gives `1 << 2 + 3 == 7` and `10 % 3 * 2 == 4`, i.e. shifts above `+`/`*` and `%` below `*`); jaic still uses the C-like table and that is not changed here.

Pointers and integers convert both ways: `cast(s64) ptr`, `cast(*u8) addr`, and `cast(*u8) 0 == null`. Integer constants cast to pointers fold to constants (`tests/stdlib/const-integer-pointer.jai`). Enum conversions are covered by `tests/stdlib/lang-conversions.jai`.

A string literal converts to `*u8`; a `string` variable does not (see [strings-and-literals.md](strings-and-literals.md)).

- String literals convert implicitly to `#type,distinct` / `#type,isa` string variants (call matching returns `LITERAL` cost; `convert_const` retags the constant), and `.[...]` literals take an expected distinct array type of the same shape.
- A call to a procedure with an `#type,isa` variant argument whose single non-macro result has exactly the variant's base type returns the variant (`pa + pb` on `Position3` stays `Position3`); see `emit_call` in `sema/calls.rs`.

## How to change it

The cast reach lives in `parse_cast_value` (`crates/jaic/src/parser/expr.rs`): it parses a unary operand, then continues `parse_binary_after` with a filter that only accepts the bitwise and shift operators. To change which operators a cast absorbs, change that filter and update `tests/stdlib/cast-operand-precedence.jai` and the parser test `prefix_cast_takes_bitwise_and_shift_operators`. Our own stdlib and tests were rewritten to `(cast(T) x) op y` where they relied on the old grouping; any new code that widens before a shift needs the parentheses.

Add a scalar conversion in `scalar_convert`, or a new aggregate/array case in the later branches of `explicit_cast`. Implicit conversions are priced by `implicit_cost`; overload resolution uses that cost, so changing it changes which overload wins. Constant operands are folded at the top of `explicit_cast`; update that table together with the runtime path or `#run` results and runtime results will diverge.

## Configuration
