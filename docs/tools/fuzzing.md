# Fuzzing

## What it is

Coverage-guided fuzzing of the compiler with [cargo-fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz) (libFuzzer). The targets in `fuzz/` feed generated input to the lexer, parser, the whole front end with the real stdlib, the interpreter and the language server, and treat every panic, abort, stack overflow, hang and runaway allocation as a bug: bad input must produce a diagnostic, never a crash.

## How it works

`fuzz/` is its own Cargo workspace (excluded from the root one, with its own `Cargo.lock`), with two packages:

- `fuzz/harness` (`jai-fuzz-harness`): one plain function per target taking `&[u8]`, plus the grammar-based program generator. It has no libFuzzer dependency, so `cargo test` can replay inputs through exactly the code the fuzzer runs.
- `fuzz` (`jai-fuzz`): the libFuzzer binaries in `fuzz/fuzz_targets/`, each a one-line call into the harness.

The harnesses call library entry points directly. Nothing on these paths uses `catch_unwind`, so a panic aborts the process and libFuzzer records it.

| Target | Input | What runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lexer` | bytes (lossy UTF-8) | `jaic::lexer::lex` |
| `parser` | bytes (lossy UTF-8) | `jaic::parser::parse_file` |
| `check` | bytes as `main.jai` | the playground compile (`jai_wasm::play::run_with` with `compile_only`): bundled stdlib, every `#run`, type checking, lowering; `main` is not run |
| `interp` | bytes as `main.jai` | `check`, then `main` in the interpreter |
| `generated` | bytes chosen by `arbitrary` | `harness::generate::program` renders a Jai program, then as `interp` |
| `lsp` | bytes as a document | `jai_language_server::Session` with the playground environment: diagnostics, symbols, semantic tokens, hover and definition at ~60 offsets, completion at 4, then an edit and the same again |
| `lsp_json` | newline-separated JSON-RPC | `JsonSession::handle_json` after an `initialize` handshake (non-UTF-8 input goes to the frame decoder instead) |

### Sandboxing

Compile-time execution and `main` run through the browser playground's sandbox, the same one `jaic run -os wasm` uses: target OS/CPU `wasm`, the stdlib from an in-memory file system, and `SandboxHost`, a small in-memory libc with no dynamic linker, real files, network or clock. `BLOCK_BUDGET` (2M interpreter basic blocks per input) stops infinite loops in `#run` and `main` with an "execution budget exhausted" diagnostic. Any hang that is left is in the compiler itself.

Compiling harnesses (`check`, `interp`, `generated`, `lsp`, `lsp_json`) run on a 256 MiB thread, the stack the wasm build links with. The native CLI and `jailsp` use 1 GiB. `lexer` and `parser` run on libFuzzer's main thread (8 MiB).

The interpreter uses real memory, so a mutated program that builds a pointer from an integer and writes through it can crash the fuzzer process. That is the program's bug, not the compiler's. Before treating a `SEGV` in `interp`/`check` as a compiler bug, check whether the input forms a pointer itself (`cast(*T)`, `xx`, `---`, pointer arithmetic). The generator never emits these forms.

### Structure-aware generation

Random bytes rarely get past the parser. `harness/src/generate.rs` reads the fuzzer's bytes through `arbitrary::Unstructured` and uses them to choose productions of a small typed grammar: enums (`enum`, `enum u8`, `enum_flags`, explicit values), structs (`using` bases, defaults, `#place`), a polymorphic struct `Box(T)`, procedures with typed parameters and returns, polymorphic procedures (`$T`), `#expand` macros (with `Code` arguments and backticks), constants (`#run` initializers), globals, `#if`/`else` declarations and `#run` blocks. `main` calls every procedure, because sema is demand-driven and checks only what is reachable. The generator tracks the locals in scope and builds expressions of a requested type, so about 70% of programs compile cleanly. One program in eight is a "chaos" program that sometimes uses a value of the wrong type, which keeps the error paths covered.

One top-level declaration in eleven is an "edge" production (`edge_decl`): a shape that crashed the compiler before, filled with numbers from the input (`0`, `-1`, powers of two up to `1 << 62`, `i64::MAX`, small negatives). These shapes are polymorphic struct and `$N` procedure recursion, `using` pointer cycles with `#align`, self-inserting strings, a cyclic `#run` pointer ring, nested huge arrays, `#no_padding` structs, shift/divide constant arithmetic, out-of-range enum values, `cast(Type) n`, distinct type cycles and inserted strings. `main` names each one with `type_of`, so sema reaches it.

### Corpora and dictionary

`fuzz/seed_corpus.py` builds `fuzz/corpus/<target>/` from the repository's own Jai files: `tests/stdlib`, `tests/corpus/{positive,negative}`, `examples` and `fuzz/seeds` for the compiling targets, plus `stdlib/` and `prelude/` for the lexer and parser. Size caps keep execution fast, and `lsp_json` gets each file wrapped in a JSON-RPC session. Saved regressions for the target are added too. `fuzz/seeds/` holds about 120 small hand-written programs that probe the compiler's limits: overflowing constants, recursive and oversized types, metaprogram misuse, odd `#insert`/`#run` use. Several of the bugs below were first found by writing such probes. Corpora are not committed (`fuzz/.gitignore`). CI caches them between runs instead. `fuzz/jai.dict` lists keywords, directives, operators and literal shapes for libFuzzer's mutator.

## Running locally

Install cargo-fuzz once (`cargo install cargo-fuzz`). The repository's nightly toolchain is picked up automatically. Then:

```sh
fuzz/run.sh check 1200 4      # target, seconds, parallel workers
fuzz/run.sh lexer 600
```

`run.sh` seeds an empty corpus, builds without a sanitizer but with debug assertions (arithmetic overflow panics), and runs libFuzzer in fork mode. Crashes, timeouts and OOMs are collected in `fuzz/artifacts/<target>/` without stopping the run. Per-target limits: `-max_len` 16 KiB (lexer/parser), 8 KiB (compiling targets), 4 KiB (LSP); `-timeout` 5/10/20 s; `-rss_limit_mb=4096`.

ASan is off on purpose. The compiler is safe Rust apart from the interpreter's program memory, and the interpreted program's own raw memory use (which ASan would flag) is not a compiler bug.

Execution speed on an M-series core is roughly 4–5k/s for lexer and parser, 250–350/s for `check`/`interp`, about 70/s for `generated` and 5–10/s for `lsp`.

## Triage and minimizing

Replay a finding without libFuzzer, and see the panic message and timing:

```sh
cargo run --release --manifest-path fuzz/harness/Cargo.toml --example replay -- check fuzz/artifacts/check/crash-*
JAI_FUZZ_VERBOSE=1 cargo run ... -- check <file>      # also print diagnostics and output
cargo run ... --example replay -- show <generated-input>  # print the generated program
```

Minimize with libFuzzer (`cargo fuzz tmin --sanitizer none --debug-assertions <target> <file>`), or by hand: crash inputs are usually small Jai files. For `generated`, minimize the printed program and file it under `check`/`interp` instead of keeping the raw bytes.

## Adding regressions

Every fixed crash gets two things:

1. The minimized input in `fuzz/regressions/<target>/` (any file name). `fuzz/harness/tests/regressions.rs` replays every file there through the same harness function on every push and pull request.
2. A test next to the fix: a parser unit test, a `crates/jai-language-server/tests/fuzz_regressions.rs` case, or a `tests/stdlib/` / `tests/corpus/negative` program run by the sweep.

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path fuzz/harness/Cargo.toml   # replay fuzz/regressions/
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`:

- `regressions` (every push and pull request): checks the dependency age of `fuzz/Cargo.lock` and runs the replay test. It takes a few minutes and needs no cargo-fuzz.
- `fuzz` (nightly at 03:23 UTC and by `workflow_dispatch`, with a `seconds` input, default 600): one ubuntu job per target. Each restores the cached corpus (`actions/cache`, key `fuzz-corpus-<target>-<run>` with a prefix restore), adds the repository seeds, runs `fuzz/run.sh` with one worker per core, minimizes the corpus with `cargo fuzz cmin` and saves it. Any finding fails the job and uploads `fuzz/artifacts/<target>` as `fuzz-artifacts-<target>`. A push to the `ci/fuzz` branch runs the same jobs for 60 seconds each, to test the workflow itself.

To act on a nightly failure, download the artifact, replay it with the `replay` example, fix it, and add the input under `fuzz/regressions/`.

## Bug classes found

Each was fixed with a regression test, and the limit it introduced is listed under Configuration.

- **Lexer:** a here-string flag (`#string,\`) at the end of the file sliced past the end of the input.
- **Parser stack overflow:** deeply nested parentheses, blocks or array types recursed until the stack overflowed. Now `MAX_NESTING` gives a diagnostic.
- **Parser hang:** `#assert(` tried the `(cond, message)` form, rewound and parsed again, so each nested `#assert(` doubled the work. The form is now chosen up front, by looking for a top-level comma.
- **LSP:** the native server ran on the 8 MiB main thread. Completion after a multibyte character split a UTF-8 boundary.
- **Oversized types:** array and struct sizes overflowed `u64` in layout, and the interpreter then aborted on the allocation. Types over `MAX_SIZE` are now an error. Allocations the host cannot make return null (`malloc`) or trap (globals).
- **Compile-time images:** every struct's default value was built in memory at the struct's full size, so a legal struct of 2^48 bytes with all-zero defaults aborted the compiler. The LSP target found this. Default images are now built only when a field has a nonzero default. Constants, initializers and default images over `MAX_IMAGE` are a diagnostic.
- **Constant folding:** `i64::MIN / -1`, `% -1`, negation and negative shift amounts overflowed or panicked.
- **Unbounded compile-time recursion:** polymorphic recursion (each instance creating a new one), a string that `#insert`s itself, and `using` pointer cycles in member lookup. These are now capped by `MAX_INSTANCES`, `MAX_INSERT_DEPTH` and a visited set.
- **Compile-time values:** a `#run` result holding a pointer cycle was copied into the program recursively until the stack overflowed. An integer cast to `Code` indexed past the code table. `#align` accepted values that broke layout arithmetic.

## How to change it

- New target: add a `pub fn <name>(data: &[u8])` to `harness/src/lib.rs`, a two-line file in `fuzz_targets/`, a `[[bin]]` in `fuzz/Cargo.toml`, a case in `run.sh` and `seed_corpus.py`, a `#[test]` in `harness/tests/regressions.rs`, the replay example's match, and the CI matrix.
- Generator: `generate.rs` is one `Gen` struct. Add a statement kind in `stmt`, an expression form in `expr` (keep it type-correct for the requested `Ty`), or a declaration in `top_decl`. Check validity with the `show` and `check` replay modes over random inputs. Never generate forms that make a pointer from an integer (see Sandboxing).
- The `jaifmt` formatter (stdlib `Jai_Format` run through the interpreter) has no target. A whole compile per input is too slow for libFuzzer. A slow periodic job would be the way to add it.

## Dependencies

cargo-fuzz 0.13 and a nightly toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`), `libfuzzer-sys` and `arbitrary` (crates.io, under the [dependency policy](dependency-policy.md)), and the internal crates `jaic`, `jai-wasm` (playground sandbox, bundled stdlib, LSP environment) and `jai-language-server`. `jai-wasm/build.rs` lets its unused cdylib leave libFuzzer's coverage hooks undefined on macOS when built with `--cfg fuzzing`.
