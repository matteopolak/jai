# Third-party native libraries

## What it is

The stdlib binds some C libraries that no system ships: `stb_image`, `stb_image_write`,
`stb_image_resize`, `stb_vorbis`, and `rpmalloc` (built with first-class heaps; macOS and Linux only), plus FreeType on
Windows (macOS and Linux use the system's, from Homebrew or the distribution). `tools/build_native_libs.py` builds them from pinned, hash-checked
sources into `artifacts/native-libs/<os>-<arch>/`. `jaic` searches that directory when it resolves a
library name, both for foreign calls at compile time or under `jaic run` and when linking `jaic build`
output. Without it, programs that use those modules type-check but can't call into them or link.

## How it works

- `tools/native-libs.json` pins each source: a GitHub repository and revision with a sha256 per
  file, or (FreeType) a source `archive` URL with its sha256 and top-level directory. Each library
  has a one-line C translation unit (`code`: `#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION` + `#include`) or a
  list of `units` with `include` directories and `defines`; `platforms` limits it to some OSes
  (`["windows"]`).
- The tool downloads the files into `artifacts/native-libs/sources/` (verifying hashes), compiles each
  unit once with `cc -O2 -fPIC`, and writes `lib<name>.a` and `lib<name>.dylib`/`.so` (macOS dylibs get
  an `@rpath/` install name).
- On Windows it compiles with `clang --target=<x86_64|aarch64>-pc-windows-msvc -fms-runtime-lib=dll`
  (the dynamic CRT `jaic build` links) and writes `<name>.lib` (`llvm-lib`) and `<name>.dll`, whose
  exports are every external symbol of the objects (`llvm-nm` into a `.def` file). `--platform
  windows-arm64` picks the CPU explicitly; `tools/stdlib_runtime.py` passes its `--platform`, since
  the Python on an arm64 runner may be an x64 build.
- `jaic-cli` (`native_lib_dirs`) passes the directory to `jaic::interp::set_library_dirs` at startup.
  - Interpreter (`interp/native.rs` `Library::open`): `<dir>/lib<name>.<dylib|so>` (Windows:
    `<dir>/<name>.dll`) is tried before the system's search, with a leading `lib` in the Jai name
    stripped.
  - Linker (`jaic-llvm` `library_args`): `<dir>/lib<name>.a` (Windows MSVC: `<dir>/<name>.lib`) is
    linked by path, so executables are self-contained. Cross builds (`-os windows` from macOS or
    Linux) ignore the directory.

```bash
python3 tools/build_native_libs.py              # all libraries
python3 tools/build_native_libs.py stb_image    # just one
python tools/build_native_libs.py --platform windows-arm64   # Windows: needs clang, llvm-lib, llvm-nm
```

The output goes to the main checkout's `artifacts/` even when run from a git worktree (resolved through
the git common dir), so worktrees share one build. `tools/jaic-sweep.py` builds any missing library
before it starts and sets `JAIC_NATIVE_LIBS` to that directory, so sweeps from any checkout or worktree
can call and link these libraries without setup.

## Slang (sgpu)

The sgpu examples (`corpus/upstream/roeyb1--sgpu`) link `modules/slang/mac/libslang`, `Vulkan_With_VMA/libs/mac/libvulkan` and `Vulkan_With_VMA/mac/VkMemAlloc`, which upstream ships as prebuilt binaries that we do not download. `tools/build_slang.py` produces them:

- Clones `shader-slang/slang` at the pinned `TAG`, with submodules, into `artifacts/thirdparty/slang`, builds a Release shared library with CMake (tests, examples, gfx, slangd, slangi, replayer, CUDA/DXIL off; glslang on), and installs `libslang.dylib` plus the modules Slang `dlopen`s beside it (`libslang-glslang-*`, `libslang-glsl-module-*`) into `modules/slang/mac/`, ad-hoc signed.
- Compiles `vk_mem_alloc.cpp` from the module's own sources into `libVkMemAlloc.a` / `libVkMemAlloc_DEBUG.a`, and copies Homebrew's Vulkan loader to `libs/mac/libvulkan.dylib`.
- Idempotent: reuses the clone/build directory and skips installed outputs (`--force` reinstalls). Paths resolve through the git common dir, so it works from a worktree and writes into the main checkout's `artifacts/` and `corpus/`.

Then build and run the examples (shaders and `sample.png` come from `tools/fetch_upstreams.py`; stb libraries from `build_native_libs.py`):

```bash
brew install cmake ninja molten-vk vulkan-loader vulkan-validationlayers
python3 tools/build_slang.py
python3 tools/build_native_libs.py
cd corpus/upstream/roeyb1--sgpu/examples && jaic build build.jai
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/opt/homebrew/etc/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json \
       VK_LAYER_PATH=/opt/homebrew/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d \
       DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/vulkan-validationlayers/lib
cd bin && ./02_compute          # run from bin/: shader paths are ../shaders/...
```

Examples request `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` (hence the layers). `04_mesh_shaders` needs `VK_EXT_mesh_shader`, which MoltenVK does not provide. `JAIC_NATIVE_LIBS` must point at the `build_native_libs.py` output when building from a worktree (the default is relative to the stdlib).

## Vk-Engine (ImGui, VMA, JoltC)

`tools/build_vk_engine_libs.py` builds the C++ libraries Vk-Engine's `Build.jai` expects under `Modules/<M>/Libs/MacOS/` (`libImGui.dylib`, `libVkMemAlloc.a`, `libJoltC.dylib`, the last from JoltC + Jolt Physics v5.6.0 through CMake). Details and options: [Vk-Engine](../native/vk-engine.md).

## How to change it

- New library: add its sources under `sources` (compute sha256 with `shasum -a 256`) and an entry under
  `libraries` whose `code` is a C unit that compiles the implementation. The name must match the Jai
  `#system_library` name (without `lib`).
- Libraries a project builds itself (focus-editor's `LightweightRenderingView` via its `build.jai`) are
  not listed here; `tools/fetch_upstreams.py` fetches C-family sources (`NATIVE_SOURCE_SUFFIXES`) for
  that, never prebuilt binaries.

## Configuration

- `JAIC_NATIVE_LIBS`: path list replacing the default directory
  (`<stdlib>/../artifacts/native-libs/<os>-<arch>`, `os` in `macos`/`linux`/`windows`, `arch` in
  `arm64`/`x64`).

## Dependencies

`cc` and `ar` on macOS and Linux; `clang`, `llvm-lib` and `llvm-nm` (the official LLVM release) and the
MSVC libraries on Windows; network access to `raw.githubusercontent.com` and `github.com` on first
build. Release archives do not include these libraries on any platform.

## wgpu-native (WebGPU)

wgpu-native is not built here: `tools/fetch_wgpu_native.py [--platform P] [--out DIR] [--force]` downloads the
release zip pinned in `tools/webgpu.json` (sha256 per platform), checks that its bundled `webgpu.yml` is the
revision the bindings were generated from, and puts the static and shared library (`libwgpu_native.a` +
`.dylib`/`.so`, or `wgpu_native.lib` + `.dll`) into the same `artifacts/native-libs/<os>-<arch>/`. Unlike the
libraries above, release archives do ship it, in `artifacts/native-libs/<platform>/` beside `stdlib/`, which is
the default search directory. See [WebGPU](../stdlib/webgpu.md).
