# Differential testing

## What it is

There is no official compiler to compare against, so jaic is checked against itself. One program can run through four backends that share a front end but little else after lowering. `tools/jaic-diff.py` runs each program through every backend and requires the same output. `tools/jaigen.py` generates random, well-defined programs to feed it, and `tools/jaic-reduce.py` shrinks a program the backends disagree on.

| Backend | What runs |
| --- | --- |
| `interp` | `jaic run`: the IR interpreter on the host |
| `native` | `jaic build -O0`, then the executable (LLVM) |
| `native-O2` | the same at `-O2`, so LLVM's optimizer is involved |
| `wasm` | the browser engine (`crates/jai-wasm`, driven by node through `tools/jaic_diff_wasm.mjs`): the interpreter compiled to wasm32, target OS `.WASM`, `SandboxHost` libc |

`interp` and `wasm` share the interpreter, but they differ in target (32-bit `.WASM` against the host), constant folding host, file system and libc. `native` and `native-O2` share only the IR with the interpreter.

## How it works

```sh
python3 tools/jaic-diff.py --jaic target/release/jaic --wasm <bundle> corpus stdlib modules gen:1:1000
```

Sets:

- `corpus`: the `tests/corpus` manifest cases with a `runtime` expectation.
- `stdlib`: `tests/stdlib/*.jai`.
- `modules`: `stdlib/*/tests` and `stdlib/tests`, with the whole `stdlib/` as the workspace, because tests `#load` their module's files.
- `gen:SEED:COUNT`: COUNT jaigen programs starting at SEED.
- A file path.

Each backend's run gives a result `(status, stdout, stderr)`:

- The status is `exit N` or `runtime error`. The backends report a failed bounds check, a panic or a signal differently, so for a runtime error only the fact is compared.
- stdout must match exactly.
- stderr must match when every backend exited normally.
- Paths are normalized first: the case root becomes `/workspace` and the stdlib becomes `/stdlib`, as the wasm sandbox names them.

Verdicts:

- `agree`: every backend that ran gave the same result.
- `DISAGREE`: they did not, including when one backend fails to compile a program another compiled.
- `invalid`: every backend failed to compile the program.
- `skip`: fewer than two backends could run the program.

The exit code is 1 on any `DISAGREE` or `invalid`. `--json FILE` writes every result, and `-v` prints them all.

### What a backend may decline (`unsupported`)

A backend is excluded from a case only for a stated reason, and as far as possible that reason comes from metadata that already exists rather than a list in the harness:

- `wasm`, stdlib tests: the reasons in the `excluded` map of `tools/playground_stdlib_expected.json`, the file the browser release is checked against (threads, sockets, native libraries).
- `wasm`, any program: the engine's own refusal messages (`foreign procedure ... is not available here`, `unknown library`, `is not supported on wasm`), and a stdlib module that rejects the target with `#assert`.
- `wasm`, missing files: a file the sandbox lacks (the sandbox holds the workspace and the stdlib only). This counts only when no host backend complained about the same file.
- `native`, no `main`: the build fails with `no exported 'main'`, so the program runs only at compile time.
- `native`, no executable: the build wrote nothing at `-o` because the program's metaprogram decides what to write (its own workspaces, `NO_OUTPUT`).
- `native`, compiler primitives: the program calls a `#compiler` primitive at run time, which exists only inside the compiler. The compiled stub says `is a compiler primitive; it runs only at compile time`.

`OUTPUT_VARIES` in the harness lists cases where only the status is compared. Each entry has its reason:

- `jaic-extensions-long-double` prints which `Long_Double` representation the target ABI has: float64 on arm64 macOS, binary128 on wasm32.
- `iprof-runtime-manual` prints measured times.

### The generator (`tools/jaigen.py`)

`tools/jaigen.py SEED [--size S]` prints one program. A seed always gives the same program. The program keeps a 64-bit FNV checksum `H`, mixes its state into it as it runs, prints intermediate values and ends with `checksum <hex>`.

It covers:

- integers of every width (`s8`..`u64`), with literals at powers of two ±1 and at float32/float64 rounding ties;
- `float32` and `float64`, including `-0.0`, subnormals and values near the largest float;
- arithmetic, bitwise operators, shifts and rotates, comparisons and `&&`/`||`;
- casts: plain, `trunc` and `no_check`, int↔float, guarded float→int;
- `#no_aoc` blocks;
- structs with defaults and nested structs, a polymorphic struct `Pair(T)`;
- fixed arrays (including arrays of structs), views, dynamic arrays with `array_add`;
- `for` over ranges (forward and reverse), over arrays by value and by pointer, bounded `while` loops, `break`/`continue`;
- `if`/`else`, `ifx`, `if x == { case ...; }` switches;
- enums, `enum_flags` and enum casts;
- `defer`, including inside loops;
- strings: literals, `tprint`, `count`, indexing and comparison;
- procedures: pure and effectful, inline, recursive with a depth argument, procedure-valued variables;
- polymorphic procedures with `$T` and `#if` on the type;
- pointers to locals;
- `#run` constants (scalar and struct) compared with the same computation at run time;
- globals;
- `print` of every type, with aggregates that hold floats printed only by count.

Programs use only behaviour that `docs/language/*.md` defines (the docstring has the rules):

- Integer `+ - *` wrap.
- Shift amounts are masked below the width.
- Division and remainder never use a divisor of 0 or -1.
- Float→int casts only see values in range.
- NaN is hashed and printed in a canonical form.
- Procedures called inside expressions are pure, because operand evaluation order is not specified.
- Loops have constant trip counts and recursion has a decreasing depth.

A run of all four backends takes about 0.55 s per program with three jobs. All but one program in the campaigns so far compiled.

### Reducing (`tools/jaic-reduce.py`)

```sh
python3 tools/jaic-reduce.py prog.jai --jaic target/release/jaic --wasm <bundle>
```

The reducer keeps a candidate if it still compiles and the backends still split into the same groups (for example `interp+native+wasm` against `native-O2`). It deletes chunks of lines down to single lines (ddmin-style), then whole `{ }` blocks, then unwraps blocks, and repeats until nothing changes. The result is `prog.reduced.jai`. The timeout defaults to 10 s, because deleting a loop counter's update makes a loop spin forever. A 250-line program typically shrinks to about 50 lines in a few hundred runs.

### Full run

Run this before a release, or after changing the interpreter, sema's constant folding, lowering or the LLVM backend. It takes about an hour on an M-series laptop. Run it with one heavy job at a time, since it builds two native executables per program:

```sh
cargo build --release -p jaic-cli
python3 tools/build_scripting_wasm.py --release --output /tmp/wasm
python3 tools/jaic-diff.py --jaic target/release/jaic --wasm /tmp/wasm --jobs 3 corpus stdlib modules
python3 tools/jaic-diff.py --jaic target/release/jaic --wasm /tmp/wasm --jobs 3 --keep /tmp/gen gen:10000:3000
```

`--keep` keeps the generated programs (`/tmp/gen/programs/gen-N/main.jai`) for reducing. Reproduce one program with `tools/jaigen.py N`.

### Bugs found

Each bug was fixed with a regression test.

| Program | Wrong backend | Bug |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/stdlib/bindings-generator-cpp-classes.jai` | native | `#cpp_return_type_is_non_pod` was ignored, so a one-`int` C++ class came back in registers while the callee wrote through the hidden pointer (`c-abi.md`) |
| `tests/stdlib/compiler-workspace-ids.jai` | native | the build tried to link workspaces that were created but given no source (`workspaces.md`) |
| stdlib programs calling Bindings_Generator at run time | native (diagnostic) | compiled `#compiler` stubs trapped without a word; they now say why |
| generated (`tests/stdlib/poly-infer-from-ifx.jai`) | front end | `$T` could not be inferred from an `ifx` argument |
| targeted probe (`tests/stdlib/int-to-float32-rounding.jai`) | interp, wasm, constant folding | 64-bit integer → `float32` rounded twice, through f64 |
| generated seed 10014 (`tests/corpus/positive/unrolled-sub-reduction.jai`) | native-O2 | LLVM 22's runtime unroller recombined parallel accumulators of an `a -= b` recurrence wrongly. jaic turns that transformation off ([LLVM backend](../native/llvm-backend.md)) |

The generated programs found 2 of these bugs. Three came from the stdlib sets, and one from a targeted probe of int-to-float conversions (jaigen now generates those edge values too). Campaigns so far: seeds 1–200, 1000–1299, 10000–12999 and 20000–22999. That is 6,500 programs on all four backends, plus 400 for compile validity. Only seed 10014 disagreed, and it agrees after the fix. One program, seed 22650, failed to compile everywhere; see Open questions.

### Open questions

Differential testing cannot find a bug that every backend shares, because they share a front end. The generator has run into one front-end behaviour that `docs/language` does not settle, and it avoids that behaviour:

- **The question.** Should a cast's target type reach an untyped literal on the left of an operator whose other operand is typed?
- **What jaic does now.** It does. `cast(float32) (0 - w)` with `w: u16 = 15` computes in `float32` and gives `-15`, where typing `0` from `w` would give `65521`.
- **The visible failure.** `cast(float32) ((0 - w) & v)` is rejected: `operator BitAnd is not defined for float32`.
- **What jaigen does instead.** It writes `cast(T) 0 - x` (seed 22650 found this).

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs a cheap subset ([continuous integration](continuous-integration.md)):

- `test` job, every OS: `--backends interp,native,native-O2 corpus gen:1:40` with the debug `jaic`.
- `scripting-wasm` job: `--backends interp,wasm corpus gen:1:40`, with an LLVM-free host `jaic` (`--no-default-features`) and the bundle the job already builds.

## How to change it

- **New backend:** add it to `ALL_BACKENDS` and to `Runner.run`, and map its failures onto the statuses above. Paths it prints need adding to `Runner.normalize`.
- **New set:** extend `cases()`. Give a `Case` a `root` when the program reads sibling files, because the wasm sandbox sees only that directory. Use `skip={backend: reason}` for a principled exclusion that metadata provides.
- **Declining a program:** prefer a message the backend itself prints, or existing metadata, over a list of names. If an entry in `OUTPUT_VARIES` is unavoidable, give it a reason that someone can check.
- **Generator:** `Gen` in `tools/jaigen.py` has `expr_int`/`expr_float`/`expr_bool` per type, `stmt` for statements and `program` for the top level. A new form must stay defined behaviour for every backend. Check validity with `gen:` sets using `--backends interp` (every program should `agree` with itself or at least compile). Never generate pointer arithmetic, uninitialized reads (`---`), or an expression whose result depends on evaluation order.
- **Overflow checks:** `.FATAL`/`.NONFATAL` arithmetic checks apply only to workspaces a metaprogram creates, so the generator does not cover them.
- **A found case:** reduce it and fix the wrong backend. Then keep the reduced program as a `tests/corpus/positive` case: add a manifest entry with `sha256` and the interpreter's `runtime` output. If only one backend or optimization level was wrong, also add a targeted test (for example in `crates/jaic-cli/tests/native.rs`).

## Configuration

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--jaic` | `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/debug/jaic` | compiler under test. It must be newer than `crates/` (`--allow-stale` overrides this) |
| `--wasm DIR` | none | bundle from `tools/build_scripting_wasm.py --output DIR`. Without it the `wasm` backend is off |
| `--backends` | all available | comma-separated subset |
| `--jobs` | 3 | cases in parallel. Each native case builds two executables |
| `--timeout` / `--memory-limit` | 120 s / 3 GiB | per process, as in the [sweep](jaic-sweep.md) |
| `--gen-size` | 1.0 | scales jaigen's procedure and statement counts |
| `--keep DIR` | temp dir | keep generated programs and executables |

The stdlib and modules sets build the [third-party native libraries](native-libs.md) first, as the sweep does.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9+.
- `tools/jaic-sweep.py`, which provides the process limits and the stale-binary check.
- node, for the wasm backend.
- The LLVM 22 toolchain behind `jaic build`.
- The browser bundle built by `tools/build_scripting_wasm.py`.
- Unit tests: `tools/test_jaic_diff.py`, which needs no compiler.
