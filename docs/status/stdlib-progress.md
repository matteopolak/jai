# Portable stdlib progress

Role: independent portable/high-level stdlib worker. No subagents, publication,
reference binaries or prior implementations used. Extensions and corpus preserved.

Latest committed checkpoint: `37aad6c`, supported Deep_Copy plus graph blocker. Earlier
checkpoints cover foundations, Unix process/thread/files/system, codecs,
allocators, Soa, Xar, command/text parsing and reviewed protocol schemas; consult
[module ledger](../portable-stdlib-ledger.md) for exact partial/remaining scope.

Previously verified checkpoint: POSIX native crash diagnostics and runtime startup
flag integration. Native C builds with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Actual protected
memory faults and raised SIGSEGV terminate with preserved signals and a native
stack in interpreter/native execution. Four worker threads independently initialize
and clean up stacks. Build_Options ON/OFF workspace tests pass native execution.
All 175 owned Jai files pass repo jaifmt --check and jailint -D warnings. The
expanded regression passes 58 interpreter/native cases, ten SMTP scenarios,
four parent-lifetime scenarios, four expected faults in both execution modes,
Xar reverse rejection, startup ON/OFF and selected Linux/Windows target checks.

Previously verified checkpoint: classic Zip_File_Directory parsing and ownership,
including malformed second-record cleanup under a counting allocator. The full
focused run now passes 59 interpreter/native cases and six expected faults in
both modes, retaining the SMTP, parent-lifetime, startup and target checks above.
All 181 owned Jai files pass jaifmt --check and jailint -D warnings. The ZIP field
and extension contract gaps are documented, not asserted as established behavior.

Previously verified checkpoint: CAS-based Atomics arithmetic/bitwise operations and
the exact alias declarations. The three alias intrinsics lack source-compiler
lowering; the original pending reproducer and handoff are documented. Full focused
regression passes 61 interpreter/native cases, seven expected faults in both
modes, two compile-time rejections, all prior SMTP/startup/parent checks and selected
Linux/Windows checks. All 188 owned Jai files pass format/lint. Four-worker tests
verify prior-value uniqueness, bit claims and zero-reaching decrement behavior.

Previously verified checkpoint: partial Deep_Copy scalar/string/resizable-array
operations, callback/preallocated/reused-map cases and conditional debug globals.
General graph support is blocked by reflected struct alignment 0 (versus 8),
reproduced in interpreter/native with retained assertions. It is not counted as
completed graph functionality. Full focused regression passes 63 cases in both
modes, nine expected faults in both modes, two compile-time rejections and prior
SMTP/startup/parent/target checks. All 197 owned Jai files pass format/lint.

Current verified checkpoint: Unix BuildCpp C/C++ compile/link/archive/object and
macOS universal outputs. Native executable and dynamically loaded function return
the expected results; stale archive members disappear on rebuild; missing tool,
invalid C and wrong-target objects report real errors after cleanup. Full focused
regression passes 64 interpreter/native cases, nine runtime faults in both modes,
five compile-time rejections, and prior SMTP/startup/parent/target checks. All
203 owned Jai files pass format/lint. The runner requires zero C-helper intermediate
directories and preserves previous output after failed compilation.

Known workarounds and incomplete behavior are recorded in
[deviations](stdlib-deviations.md), [gaps](../portable-stdlib-gaps.md) and the
module ledger. Next: finish regression/checkpoint, then continue remaining owned
portable modules using reviewed specifications. Full corpus/release integration
remains the coordinator's responsibility.

## Replacement integration checkpoint

All eight manifest snapshots merged in separate commits, ending at `6822bc1`.
Combined compiler/LSP/jailint source build and unchanged jaifmt O2 build against
production `stdlib` exited zero. Workspace tests and direct audit are in progress;
no full integration pass is claimed. See [integration evidence](../tools/cleanroom-integration.md).
