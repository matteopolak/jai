# Stack traces (`context.stack_trace`)

## What it is

While a program runs, under `jaic run` or as a `jaic build` executable, `context.stack_trace` points at a linked list of `Stack_Trace_Node`s, innermost procedure first, as in the official compiler. `print_stack_trace`, assertion failures and the memory debugger's leak reports read it.

## How it works

- At lowering (`sema/procs.rs`, `lower_body_code`) every procedure that takes a context, and is
  not `inline` or `#no_debug`, gets `Func.trace = Some(TraceInfo { name, file, line, col })`.
- The interpreter tracks `trace_loc`: inside untraced procedures (`inline`, `#no_debug`) it holds the
  location of the call that entered them, so a traced call made there records the caller's own line
  (test: `tests/stdlib/stack-trace-line-through-inline.jai`).
- `Interp::exec` (`interp/mod.rs`) pushes a node when such a function is entered. The node lives in
  the callee's interpreter stack frame (32 bytes after the frame). Its fields: `next` (the
  previous top), `info` (a leaked `Stack_Trace_Procedure_Info` cached per `FuncId`), `hash`,
  `call_depth` (previous + 1, first node 1) and `line_number`.
- The caller's node `line_number` is the line of the call being made: on entry the callee writes
  the interpreter's current source location (`Inst::Loc`) into `previous.line_number`. A fresh
  node starts with the procedure's declaration line.
- On return `context.stack_trace` is restored to `next`. `exec` also restores `self.loc` so a
  statement with several calls reports the right line for each.
- `Program.stack_trace_offset` (byte offset of `stack_trace` in `#Context`) and
  `Program.file_paths` are filled by `Compiler::enable_stack_traces`, called from `run_program` and
  from `call_thunk` (so `#run` code also gets traces; the thunk itself has no node, so the first
  node's `next` is null). Nothing is pushed when the offset is `None`.
- **Compiled output**: `Compiler::prepare_compiled_output` (called by both `jaic build` and the
  metaprogram's output path before the backend writes) runs `stack_trace::instrument`
  (`crates/jaic/src/stack_trace.rs`), an IR pass. Each traced function gets a 32-byte node slot; a new
  entry block links it (depth and hash from the previous top, or 1 and a seed for the first node) and
  makes it the top; every `Ret` restores the previous top; after each `Loc` whose statement makes a
  call, the line is stored into the node, so callees see their call line. A
  `Stack_Trace_Procedure_Info` global per function holds name, declaration site and address. The pass
  clears `Func.trace`, so the interpreter does not push a second node. Test: `stack_traces` in
  `crates/jaic-cli/tests/native.rs`.
- `runtime_support_assertion_failed` (`stdlib/Runtime_Support.jai`) prints
  `path:line,col: Assertion failed: message` then `Stack trace:` and one `path:line: name` per
  node, in the official format.

## How to change it

- The node layout must match `Stack_Trace_Node` in `prelude/diagnostics.jai` (and the constants in
  `trace_enter`).
- Hash values differ from the official compiler's; they only mix the caller hash, procedure id and call line.
- There is no sentinel node from `push_context`, and leaf procedures also get nodes (the official
  compiler omits them), so call depths can differ in those cases.

## Configuration

`Build_Options.stack_trace` (default true) is read for workspaces created by a metaprogram
(`BuildSettings.stack_trace`, `Options.stack_trace`).

## Dependencies

`ir::Func::trace`, `ir::Program::{file_paths, stack_trace_offset}`, `interp::Interp::trace_enter`.
Tests: `tests/stdlib/stack-trace-nodes.jai`, `tests/stdlib/compile-time-stack-trace.jai`.
