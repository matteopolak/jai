# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- jailint rule `wrapping_constant` (warn): a constant that silently wraps to the type of the other operand of `/`, `%` or an ordering comparison, such as `(0xffff_ffff - 40) / h` or `h < 0x8000_0000` with `h: s32`. The help shows the value the operator really uses and suggests computing in `s64` (or `u64`).
- Browser build: `jai_play_set_styled(1)` renders errors with ANSI colour and box drawing, for output panes that draw them.
- `Build_Options.cast_bounds_check` (`.FATAL` by default, `.NONFATAL`, `.OFF`): a runtime integer cast, `cast(T)` or `xx`, to a narrower type checks that the value fits, in `jaic run`, `#run` and built executables: ``error: runtime error: cast of 300 to `u8` overflows`` with a help on `cast,trunc`/`xx,trunc` and `cast,no_check`. Casts to a type at least as wide never check. See `docs/language/casts-and-conversions.md`.
- A `#complete` switch on an enum without a default label stops the program when the value is none of the members (``no case of the `#complete` switch matches its value, 7``) instead of running no case.
- Built executables say which check failed and where before they stop: an array index out of range (with the index and count), a cast that overflows, an unmatched `#complete` switch, an integer division by zero and a missing `return` print `path:line: error: <message>` through Runtime_Support's `runtime_support_check_failed`, in the interpreter's words. Before, they trapped silently.
- A crash in native code that `jaic run` or `#run` called (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL or SIGFPE; access violations and the like on Windows) names the foreign procedure, the Jai line that called it and the interpreter's call stack, and exits with status 121, instead of killing jaic without a message.
- `ok:, toki.str = f();`: a mixed declaration list can assign to members, indexes and dereferences alongside the names it declares.
- Struct literals without a dot in expressions, `f({1})` and `f({.A, 1})`, which code in the upstream corpus uses.
- A mismatched `return` value gets a note pointing at the declared return type.
- `Type_Info_Struct_Member.Flags.OVERLAY`: set on members declared after `#overlay(f)`, so serializers such as toml-jai can skip them.
- `Basic.string_to_float64_new`, which returns success first (`ok, value, rest`).
- `Bindings_Generator`: `Library_Info.identifier`, the name the bindings give a library; `will_print_bindings` may change it (sgpu's Vulkan generator).
- A one-byte string constant is a `u8` in arithmetic with an integer (`c - "0"`), as a `u8` argument (`split(s, ".")`, where no `string` overload exists) and in a cast (`cast(u8, "\u001F")`), as comparisons already allowed.

### Changed

- `Bindings_Generator`: `Enum.enumerates` holds `*Declaration`s, one constant declaration per value with its `Literal` as the expression, and `Literal.enum_value` is a `*Declaration`. Visitors see the values after their enum and can drop one with `OMIT_FROM_OUTPUT`. Vk-Engine's and sgpu's Vulkan generators run; generators written for the older `Enum.Enumerate` values no longer type-check. `Library_Info.name` is now the library's file name; its Jai name moved to `identifier`.
- Error messages say what is wrong and, where jaic can tell, what to change. See `docs/compiler/diagnostics.md` for the style guide, the layouts and the exit statuses.
  - One renderer (`jaic::render`) draws diagnostics for `jaic` and `jailint`: rustc's layout with context lines, labels, `help:` lines and fix previews, in colour on a terminal (`--color auto|always|never`, `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`) and with box drawing where the terminal supports it (`JAIC_DIAGNOSTICS=plain|ascii|unicode`). Piped output keeps the `path:line:col: error: message` form, with paths relative to where jaic started.
  - Runtime errors name the check that failed (an array index outside the array, with the index and count, null dereference, division by zero...), point at the user's line, and list the call stack innermost first with standard-library frames folded and internal names hidden. A failed `assert` shows its message or its condition (``assertion failed: `x == 4` is false``), in `jaic run` and in built executables alike.
  - An unknown identifier names the module that declares it (``help: `print` is declared in the `Basic` module: add `#import "Basic";` ``), the build metaprogram that adds it, or a similar visible name. A missing module points at a nearby folder that holds it and the `-import_dir` that finds it.
  - Type and call mismatches underline the value or argument, show the declaration as a note, and suggest the conversion (`cast`, `.data`, `tprint`, `.*`, `#char`); an unknown member or parameter suggests the closest one or lists them. `#assert` failures show the condition and, for `OS`/`CPU` checks, the target being compiled for.
  - A metaprogram's own error (`compiler_report`, a workspace marked as failed) is shown at the place it names, without the compile-time-execution prefix.
  - Names and tokens in messages are quoted with backticks (`` `x` ``) rather than single quotes.
  - Command lines: `jaic` and `jailsp` take `--help` and `--version`, `jailint` and `jaifmt` `--help`; all four suggest the closest command, option or rule for a typo, and exit with 2 for a command-line mistake. `jaic` explains an unwritable output, a missing linker, a link failure (missing library or symbol), a program without `main` and an unknown library. `jailint` and `jaifmt` report config mistakes as ``in `path`, line N: ...`` with the fix, and `jaifmt` errors use the `error:`/`help:` form with `--color`. `jailsp` run from a terminal explains that an editor starts it.
  - `jaic check` words its warning about workspace output it does not write as ``warning: `jaic check` does not write build/game (workspace `Build` asks for an executable)`` with ``help: `jaic build first.jai` (or `jaic run first.jai`) writes it``.

### Fixed

- A procedure that changes a struct or string parameter (`advance(*s, 1)`, `p.a += 1`) changes its own copy: before, it changed the caller's variable, in `jaic run`, `#run` and built executables.
- A `$$` parameter whose argument is omitted bakes its constant default, so `#if must` works in the body of `skip :: (p: *$T, $$must := false)` called as `skip(p)`.
- A struct literal's `null` (`U.{p = null}`) clears what a union member's default (`s: string = "default"`) put in the same storage.
- `using g;` of a global `g: *S` at file scope no longer reports "struct `S` contains itself" while `S`'s field types are resolved.
- `FormatFloat` and `FormatInt` print variants of variants (`#type,isa` of a `#type,distinct float64`) instead of `<non-float>`.
- `jaic run`: a `#c_call` procedure stored in memory C reads (a struct field such as `AURenderCallbackStruct.inputProc` or `WNDCLASSEXW.lpfnWndProc`, a global, an array) is now a real C function pointer, not an interpreter-internal value C crashed calling. C may call it from its own threads (an audio render thread); the call waits until the interpreter is inside a foreign call. Jai code calling the stored pointer, and comparing it with the procedure, still works.
- `Clipboard`: `os_clipboard_set_bitmap` no longer fails for every bitmap on Windows, macOS and Linux. Its overflow check divided a wrapped `0xffff_ffff - 40` (`-41` as an `s32`) by the height; found by `wrapping_constant`.
- `#asm` instructions whose destination is a general-purpose register (`pmovmskb.x found:, v;`, `movmskps`, `cvttsd2si`, `pextrq`) accept a register declared in the destination, in the interpreter and LLVM alike.
- Enum members written `A : :5` parse.
- `print(..., code_to_string(compiler_get_code(root)))` in `#run` no longer reruns the compile-time code until it exhausts memory: reparsing the same code for an export request reuses its id.
- The assertion and check reports of built executables show paths relative to the directory the build ran in, like `jaic run`.
- `jaifmt --check` prints the files it would change relative to the current directory.
- `jailint` given a file that a module's `module.jai` loads (`jailint stdlib/Compiler/workspace.jai`) checks it as part of that module, so the module's exported procedures are no longer reported as unused.
- `File_Async.initialize_queue` no longer tests the result of `Thread.init` on its condition variables, which returns nothing; any program importing `File_Async` failed to compile.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- CI type-checks every stdlib module with `-no_dce` for linux, macos, windows and wasm (`crates/jaic-cli/tests/stdlib_targets.rs`, expectations in `tests/stdlib-targets.txt`), so a type error in code for another platform or in a procedure nothing calls fails the build. See `docs/tools/stdlib-target-check.md`.
- CI checks every Objective-C selector the stdlib sends: it must take as many arguments as it is sent with (one per `:`), and on macOS the class or protocol must have the method in the runtime (`crates/jaic-cli/tests/objc_selectors.rs`, known gaps in `tests/objc-selectors.txt`). See `docs/tools/objc-selector-check.md`.
- `JAIC_MEMORY_LIMIT=<bytes|nK|nM|nG>`: an exact cap on what `jaic` allocates (compiler, interpreter and the program's C `malloc` calls). Crossing it prints `error: memory limit of N MiB exceeded` and exits with status 120. The corpus sweep uses it for `--memory-limit` instead of sampling resident memory.
- `jailint`, a linter for Jai whose rules run on the type-checked program. The rules are `index_only_loop`, `manual_index_counter`, `unused_variable`, `unused_parameter`, `unused_import`, `redundant_cast`, `bool_comparison`, `format_arg_count`, `shadowed_it`, `defer_in_loop`, `float_equality` (off by default) and `lossy_xx` (off by default).
  - Diagnostics are printed in rustc's layout. `--fix` applies the safe fixes, `-A`/`-W`/`-D` set levels, and the exit status is non-zero when a `deny` rule fires.
  - Settings come from `jailint.toml` (levels and excluded paths). Findings can be suppressed with `// jailint: allow(rule)`, `// jailint: allow-file(rule)` or `@jailint_allow(rule)`.
  - Workspaces a `build.jai` metaprogram creates are linted too.
  - Release archives and the Nix package include `jailint`, and CI lints the repository's Jai code with it. See `docs/tools/jailint.md`.
- jailint rules for likely bugs: `absurd_comparison` (`u >= 0` on an unsigned value), `almost_swapped`, `bitwise_precedence` (operators that group unlike C, `1 << n - 1`), `duplicate_condition`, `erasing_op`, `identical_branches`, `identical_operands`, `infinite_loop` (a `while` whose condition nothing changes), `integer_division_in_float`, `min_max`, `no_effect`, `range_past_count` (`for i: 0..xs.count` indexing `xs[i]`), `remove_in_for`, `reversed_range`, `self_assignment` and `unused_result` (`trim(line);`); and for unidiomatic code: `identity_op`, `manual_assign_op` and `needless_bool`. All `warn` by default. Each rule has its own section in `docs/tools/jailint.md`.
- `jailsp`: lint fixes are preferred quick fixes that carry their diagnostic and the rule (`data.rule`), with sentence-case titles; `source.fixAll.jailint` applies every safe fix at once; diagnostics link to their rule's docs (`codeDescription`); code action requests honour `context.only` and `context.diagnostics`; an open `jailint.toml` (sent with `didOpen`, as the browser build does) configures the lints of the documents below it.
- `jailsp` publishes jailint's findings as diagnostics (the rule as the code, `jailint` as the source) and offers their fixes as quick-fix code actions. It reuses the compile that hover and inlay hints already use.
- `jaic::build::WorkspaceObserver` lets embedders see each workspace's compiler.
- Release binaries (`jaic`, `jailsp`, `jailint`) are built with profile-guided optimisation on every platform except Windows arm64, where the profile runtime does not work, and the Linux ones are further optimised with BOLT. `tools/build_pgo.py` builds them the same way locally. See `docs/tools/pgo-and-bolt.md`.
- `#asm` accepts the F16C, SHA and GFNI extensions: `vcvtph2ps`/`vcvtps2ph` (all imm8 rounding modes, NaNs, subnormals and overflow as on hardware; MXCSR rounding is round-to-nearest), `sha1rnds4`, `sha1nexte`, `sha1msg1`, `sha1msg2`, `sha256rnds2` (`xmm0` as an explicit last operand), `sha256msg1`, `sha256msg2`, and `gf2p8mulb`, `gf2p8affineqb`, `gf2p8affineinvqb` in legacy, VEX and EVEX (masked, broadcast) forms. Like the rest of `#asm` they run on any host CPU.
- Windows x64: C code can call back into `#c_call` procedures running in the interpreter (`jaic run`, `#run`), with the Microsoft x64 convention: arguments by position in RCX/RDX/R8/R9 or XMM0-XMM3, the stack after them, aggregates that are not 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes by pointer, and large results through the hidden pointer.
- Windows: programs that start threads run in the interpreter. `CreateThread`, waits on thread, semaphore and event handles, critical sections, SRW locks, condition variables, `Sleep` and `SwitchToThread` go through the cooperative thread scheduler.
- MSVC builds write a PDB next to the executable or DLL (`<name>.pdb`) when debug information is on.

- `jaic build -os wasm` compiles to a wasm64 (Memory64) WASI module linked with `wasm-ld`; `-target wasm64-unknown-unknown` leaves out the runtime so the host supplies the imports. See `docs/native/wasm-target.md`.
  - Metaprograms target it with `os_target = .WASM`, `cpu_target = .CUSTOM` and `llvm_options.target_system_triple`/`_cpu`/`_features`; `additional_linker_arguments` go to `wasm-ld`.
  - `#foreign` procedures and `#elsewhere` globals become wasm imports (module `env` without a library, else the library's name), and `#program_export` procedures are exported.
  - `stdlib/Wasi_Runtime`, written in Jai, provides `_start`, the heap, stdio, the environment and the clock on WASI preview 1; jaic adds it when the triple names WASI.
  - `wasm-ld` comes from `JAIC_WASM_LD`, the LLVM install or an LLD package (`lld`, `lld-23`). wasm32 is refused.
- `#intrinsic "llvm.<name>"` on a bodiless procedure calls that LLVM intrinsic in native builds.
- `jaifmt.wasm`: jaifmt compiled to WebAssembly (`jaifmt/wasm.jai`): source on stdin, `--config <toml>` or `JAIFMT_CONFIG`, result on stdout. Browser bundles include it (`build_scripting_wasm.py --jaic`, required by `package_browser_release.py`). It formats about 35 times faster than the interpreted playground driver, and CI checks its output against native jaifmt on every golden case.
- `jaifmt/build.jai`: `jaic build jaifmt/build.jai` builds an optimised `target/jaifmt` through the Compiler module; `- wasm` builds `target/jaifmt.wasm` and `- -o <file>` picks the output.
- `tools/jaic-diff.py` has a `wasm-native` backend, and `tools/wasi_run.mjs` runs WASI modules under node.
- `Build_Options.dead_code_elimination` and `-no_dce`: `.MODULES_ONLY` (the default) type-checks everything declared in the program's own files, `.NONE` modules too, `.ALL` only what the program reaches. See `docs/language/dead-code-elimination.md`.
- `jailsp` publishes the type checker's first error as a `jai-check` diagnostic, and checks metaprograms that create workspaces.

- Release archives include `jaifmt` (`jaifmt.exe` on Windows), built by the release's `jaic` with `-O2`.

### Changed

- The `jaifmt` program moved from `tools/jaifmt/` to a top-level `jaifmt/` directory, since `tools/` holds repository-maintenance scripts: build it with `jaic build jaifmt/main.jai -O2 -o target/jaifmt`. The formatter library is still `stdlib/Jai_Format`, and the browser bundle's `jaifmt-playground.jai` and `jaifmt.wasm` keep their names.
- The program's own files are type-checked whether or not anything uses them, like the official compiler's default dead-code elimination. A global, constant or procedure body nothing references used to go unchecked, so programs with errors there compiled. A `#run` inside such a body now runs. Imported modules are unchanged: their unreferenced bodies stay unchecked. Compiled output still contains only what the program reaches, and `jaic build` now also drops code that only compile-time checking lowered.
- Casts no longer push their type into the operand: `cast(float32) (0 - w)` with `w: u16 = 15` subtracts in `u16` (`65521`) and then converts, where it used to compute `-15` in `float32`. Likewise an untyped literal operand takes the other operand's type rather than a declaration's or parameter's (`f: float32 = 0 - w;`). Code that relied on the old float arithmetic needs the cast on the operand: `cast(float32) 0 - w`.
- LLVM 23: the native backend is built against LLVM 23.1 (llvm-sys 231, Inkwell from a pinned commit of its main branch until a crates.io release supports LLVM 23). Building from source needs LLVM 23 and `LLVM_SYS_231_PREFIX` instead of `LLVM_SYS_221_PREFIX`; release archives, CI and the Nix flake use LLVM 23. The `-unroll-add-parallel-reductions=false` workaround for LLVM 22's miscompiled `sub` reductions is gone, since 23.1.0 fixes the unroller.
- `tools/check_dependency_age.py` accepts git dependencies pinned to a full commit hash on GitHub that is at least 14 days old.
- Every `tests/stdlib` program must pass in the browser engine; CI and the browser release fail otherwise. Tests skip what the WASM target lacks (processes, native libraries, windows) themselves, and `tools/playground_stdlib_expected.json` is gone.

### Fixed

- Under `jaic run`, `get_path_of_running_executable` returns the executable `jaic build` would write for the program (`src/main` for `jaic run src/main.jai`) instead of `jaic`'s own path, so programs that load data relative to their executable (`../assets`) find it.
- `jaic run` writes the executables and libraries a metaprogram's workspaces ask for, as `jaic build` does (it only interprets the top-level program instead of compiling it), so `jaic run first.jai` on a build script builds and can launch its program. `-no_workspace_output` skips them. `jaic check` still writes nothing, and now warns when a workspace asks for output, naming the `jaic build` command that writes it.
- `Process.create_process` (and so `run_command`) logs why a program could not be started (`could not start "./build/game": No such file or directory`) instead of failing silently.
- macOS `Input`: a click no longer quits the program, and closing a window does. The adapter watched every window in `NSApp.windows` and queued `QUIT` when one went away, but AppKit adds and drops windows of its own; closed windows were never released, so they never went away. It now follows only the windows `Window_Creation` made (`Window_Type.macos_program_windows`) and queues `QUIT` when one is no longer visible without being minimized.
- macOS: `NSEvent.keyRepeatDelay`, `keyRepeatInterval` and `pressedMouseButtons` are class methods, as in AppKit; they were sent to an event and stopped the program. `swapBuffers` moved from `LightweightRenderingView` to `LightweightOpenGLView`, the only view that has an OpenGL context.
- `jaic check -os wasm` and `jaic run -os wasm` set `CPU` to `.CUSTOM`, as `jaic build -os wasm` and the browser do; they kept the host's CPU, so the same program saw `.X64` on one machine and `.ARM64` on another.
- macOS `Input.get_input_pointer_position` sent `convertPointToScreen` without its `:` and stopped the program.
- `Input`: `update_window_events` installs the platform event adapter, which nothing installed before: programs got no window events, and on macOS the window never appeared.
- Type errors in stdlib code that was never checked, found by the new stdlib target check: the macOS input adapter, `Window_Creation.toggle_fullscreen` on macOS (`NSWindow.screen` was missing), the x11 adapter's text input, `Foundation`/`Metal` return types that named `NSDictionary` without parameters, `File` known folders on Windows, `Socket` addresses on Windows, `GL` info logs, `Simp` font cleanup, `GetRect` color strips, text hit-testing and Windows cursors, `ImGui.CreateContext`, `Text_File_Handler.file_to_table`, the Vulkan, d3d, dxc and nvtt wrappers, `pl_mpeg`, `rpmalloc`, `Thekla_Atlas`, `Shared_Memory_Channel` on Windows and `POSIX_old`.
- `File.read_entire_file(path, zero_terminated := false, log_errors := true)` takes `zero_terminated` like the official module; a second positional argument meant `log_errors` before.
- `Objective_C`, `macos` and `Metal` stop with an `#assert` off Apple platforms instead of an unknown identifier.
- A struct constant that names a member of its struct (`size_of(type_of(info))`) no longer fails with a circular dependency when the struct is declared inside another struct and nothing uses it.
- An enum member's value may name the enum itself (`B :: A + cast(E) 50`).
- Compile-time pointer constants with the top bit set (`cast(HKEY) cast(s32) 0x80000000`) keep their value instead of failing with `a compile-time value holds a pointer to memory of unknown size`.
- A release `jaic` (and `jailint`, `jailsp`) started through a symlink, e.g. unpacked into `/opt` and linked from a bin folder, now finds the `stdlib` folder next to the real file. On macOS it looked next to the link and then fell back to the CI runner's path (`could not read file /Users/runner/work/jai/jai/stdlib/Preload.jai`). A missing standard library is now reported as such, with how to fix it.
- An omitted argument binds a polymorphic type its default determines: `error :: (code: int, platform_code: $T = 0)` called as `error(3)` makes `T` `s64` instead of failing with "could not infer polymorphic type".
- `Basic.create_heap` no longer passes an `Allocator_Caps` value to `assert`'s `bool` parameter (found with `-no_dce`).
- `jaic run` on a file without `main` that has `#program_export` procedures runs its compile-time code and exits 0 instead of asking for an exported `main`.
- Windows: `file_open(for_writing = true)` handles can also read, as on POSIX, so `Zip_File_Directory.load_zip_directory` works there.
- Windows release and `windows-native` CI builds link the official LLVM 23 archive again: `tools/windows-llvm/prepare.sh` supplies the zlib, zstd and libxml2 libraries its `llvm-config` names and turns zstd's absolute build-machine path, which llvm-sys could not pass to rustc, into a library name.
- The browser engine's sandbox implements `chmod`/`fchmod`, so `MacOS_Bundler` runs there.
- Standard library: unused variables and imports removed, a shadowed `it` in `Compiler` named, and index loops in `Basic` and `Math` turned into element loops (found by jailint).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- `jailsp`: macro, `#insert`, `#run` and `#if` expansions on hover and as documents, inlay hints (inferred types, parameter names where parameters share a type, `#run` values), format-string checks and hovers, `#import`/`#load` links, references, rename, signature help, folding, code lenses for polymorph instances, workspace symbols and type definitions.
- A language tour (`examples/tour/`) that the browser playground opens by default.
- Fuzzing: cargo-fuzz targets for the lexer, parser, checker, interpreter, generated programs and the language server, with nightly CI and a regression replay on every push.
- A C ABI check compares the stdlib's hand-written system bindings with the real C headers on every CI host (sizes, alignment, field offsets, constants).
- `jaic --timings` prints wall time per compile phase; `tools/compile_bench.py` benchmarks compile times on real projects.
- Native Windows executables (x86-64): `jaic build` on Windows writes `.exe`/`.dll`/`.lib` files using the Microsoft x64 calling convention, linked with clang (or `lld-link`/`link.exe`) against the MSVC runtime. From macOS and Linux, `jaic build file.jai -os windows` cross-compiles with MinGW-w64; `-target <triple>` picks any LLVM triple. The Windows archive now includes the LLVM backend. See `docs/native/windows.md`.
- Windows on arm64: `jaic build` on an arm64 Windows host writes arm64 executables, DLLs and libraries (MSVC runtime, via clang or `lld-link`), and `jaic build file.jai -os windows -cpu arm64` cross-compiles from macOS and Linux with llvm-mingw (`-target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` or `aarch64-w64-mingw32` also work). C calls follow AAPCS64 with the Windows variadic rule (every argument of a variadic call in general registers, no float-aggregate treatment). The interpreter there calls C libraries, including variadic ones, and C can call back into interpreted `#c_call` procedures. `Windows.jai` declares the arm64 `CONTEXT`. Releases include a `windows-arm64` archive. `-cpu x64|arm64` is new; `-os windows` alone still means x64 when cross-compiling.
- Windows runtime: UTF-8 command-line arguments, a crash handler that prints the exception and a backtrace, and `#program_export` procedures exported from DLLs.
- The interpreter on Windows loads DLLs and calls foreign procedures (`#run`, `jaic run` and metaprograms that use C libraries). Callbacks from C into interpreted code are not supported there yet.
- Native debug information: `jaic build` emits DWARF (a `.dSYM` next to the executable on macOS) with source lines, procedure names and typed locals, parameters and globals, so lldb and gdb can set breakpoints by `file.jai:line`, step and print variables. On by default; `--no-debug-info` or `Build_Options.emit_debug_info = .NONE` turns it off.
- `#asm`: division (`div`/`idiv`, trapping like hardware), widening (`cqo`, `cdqe`, ...), string instructions with `rep_`/`repe_`/`repne_` prefixes and the direction flag, `shld`/`shrd`, `rcl`/`rcr`, BMI1/BMI2, `adcx`/`adox`, `crc32`, the parity flag, `lahf`/`sahf`, `xlat` and `cmpxchg8b`/`cmpxchg16b`.
- `#asm`: AVX-512 op-mask registers (`omr`) with the `k*` instructions, compares into masks, merge/zero masking on every vector instruction and masked stores.
- `#asm`: a much wider SIMD set: saturating and horizontal arithmetic, FMA, shuffles, permutes, blends, unpacks, inserts/extracts, packs, conversions, compress/expand, ternary logic, scatter, AES and `pclmulqdq`. SSE–AVX2 results were checked against x86-64 hardware; AVX-512 has hand-computed tests.
- `#asm` accepts every CPUID feature name as a modifier (`#asm AVX512_VBMI`, `GFNI`, ...).
- `Bindings_Generator` matches the reference module's public API and output: system types are referred to by name, unnamed parameters become `unknownN`, comments are placed before or after a declaration like the reference, `extern "C"` blocks are walked, packed members get `#align`, and macros that reference enum constants are dropped or rewritten. The generators shipped with the reference modules (Curl, lz4, stb, POSIX, Socket, nvtt, macho, CoreFoundation) run under `jaic` and their output type checks.
- `Bindings_Generator`: C++ virtual bases (own vtable pointer, base placed at clang's offset, offset checks) and renamed overloads that are equal in Jai, with `/*const reference*/` comments.
- `Bindings_Generator`: `Block_X_literal` constructors turn Jai `#c_call` procedures into Objective-C blocks (`objc_make_block` and `objc_block_user_data` in `Objective_C`).
- `Bindings_Generator`: with `use_jaic_long_double = false`, 16-byte `long double` members keep their layout as `[16] u8` and functions passing one are stripped with a log line; Objective-C methods passing one (including the x86-64 `objc_msgSend_fpret` case) are always stripped. Printf wrappers are made for any variadic whose last argument is a `char *`.
- `Jaic_Extensions`, a module for jaic-only, non-standard features. Its first is `Long_Double` (`#jaic_type long_double`): C's `long double` with the target's format (x87 80-bit on x86-64 SysV and MinGW, binary128 on arm64 Linux and wasm32, `float64` on Apple arm64 and MSVC). Arithmetic, comparisons and casts run at full precision (native LLVM types in builds, a soft-float in the interpreter that matches x87 hardware bit for bit), and it is passed by the C ABI through `#foreign` and `#c_call`. `print` shows it through `float64`. See `docs/language/jaic-extensions.md`.
- `Bindings_Generator`: `use_jaic_long_double` (default on) binds functions using a 16-byte `long double` with `Long_Double` instead of stripping them.
- `Toolchains`: Android NDK helpers and the macOS SDK path; `Compiler` gains a default minimum macOS version.
- `jaifmt`, a Jai code formatter written in Jai: the `Jai_Format` stdlib module (`format_source`, `parse_config`; no file access, so it also runs in the browser playground through `tools/jaifmt/playground.jai`) and the `tools/jaifmt` command line: indentation, operator and comma spacing, brace placement, blank lines and trailing whitespace. It keeps comments, string literals, here-strings and `#asm` bodies, never wraps lines, supports `jaifmt.toml` (indent width, brace style, ignore globs) and `// jaifmt: off` regions, and refuses to write output whose token stream differs from the input. `--check` for CI, `--stdin` for editors.
- `jaic run file.jai -- args` passes `args` to the program (`get_command_line_arguments`).
- Metaprogram plugins: `jaic check|build file.jai -plug Name [plugin options]` (Tracy, Iprof, ...). `Metaprogram_Plugin` gains the newer `init` hook.
- The upstream corpus pins rluba's libraries (jai-tracy, jai-redis, uniform, cluster, jai-csv, jai-postgres, stubborn, hyperserve, wait_group, jai-date) with 15 sweep cases.

### Changed

- The language server binary is now `jailsp` (was `jai-lsp`); update editor configurations that launch it.
- Binary operator precedence follows Jai instead of C: the bitwise and shift operators (`& | ^ << >> <<< >>>`) share one level that binds tighter than `*`, and `%` binds looser than `*` and `/` but tighter than `+` and `-`. `1 << 2 + 3` is now 7, `1 | 2 & 4` is 0, `10 % 3 * 2` is 4 and `b | a << 8` is `(b | a) << 8`. Code written for C's grouping changes meaning silently; the stdlib and tests were parenthesized. See `docs/language/operators.md`.
- A module parameter without a written type (`FRAMES := 3`) stays an untyped constant when the importer passes an untyped number, so it converts to any integer type its value fits, like `FRAMES :: 3`.
- A prefix `cast(T)` / `xx` now takes a following chain of bitwise and shift operators (`& | ^ << >> <<< >>>`) as part of its value, matching Jai: `cast(float) (hex >> 16) & 0xFF` masks before converting, and `cast(u32) byte << 16` shifts the `u8` before widening. Arithmetic, comparisons and logical operators still apply to the cast's result. Code that relied on the old grouping needs `(cast(T) x) << n`; the stdlib and tests were updated.
- `jaifmt` output is canonical, like rustfmt: exactly zero or one space between tokens (binary operators always spaced, no alignment runs, one space before trailing comments, `.{ a, b }` literals), one statement per line, non-empty `{ }` bodies expanded onto their own lines, and a `{` or `else` on its own line always joined to its header (including `if s == "a"`, `if x ==` switches and blank lines in between). Output is idempotent; `tests/native/debug-info` is excluded because the debugger test pins line numbers.

### Fixed

- `#complete` switches report a missing enum case.
- A struct member with an undefined type is an error; the struct silently came out empty. Every declared struct is now laid out, as in Jai.
- Linux arm64 and other system bindings had x86-64 layouts (`stat`, pthread types, `ipc_perm`, signal contexts, `epoll_event` and more), found by the C ABI check.
- `push_allocator(proc, data)` takes effect.
- Crashes and hangs found by fuzzing: deep nesting, nested `#assert(`, oversized types and allocations, constant-folding overflow, `using` pointer cycles, unbounded polymorphic recursion and `#insert` recursion, pointer cycles in `#run` values.
- A top-level `#insert` that builds declarations from a metaprogram-filled `#placeholder` runs once the placeholder is defined (it could be dropped after a failed retry), and a placeholder reached through an import gives way to its definition. Vk-Engine's Editor module checks again.
- `pointer & int`, `pointer | int` and `pointer ^ int` are defined and keep the pointer type (`cast(u64) p & MASK`).
- `cast(bool)` of a number, enum or pointer tests for non-zero; it kept the low byte, so `!cast(bool) 2` was true.
- Arithmetic on an untyped struct literal passed as an argument takes the parameter's type (`f(.{300, -1} * scale)`).
- A `name:` marker in a declaration statement (`ok, shader:, time := f()`) declares every name; it treated the unmarked names as existing variables.
- Uncalled procedures with notes in imported modules are no longer type checked for intercepting metaprograms (only the program's own files are), so Vk-Engine's `Common` module, which has a stale `@PrintLike` procedure, compiles again.
- A struct member's `#align N` now replaces its natural alignment (it could only raise it), so packed C layouts can be reproduced.
- `New` of an `#align 64` type (and any default-allocator or `rpmalloc` block of 64 bytes or more, including `realloc` and array growth) is now 64-byte aligned; it was only 16-aligned, so such objects were misaligned intermittently. Larger alignments are not guaranteed for heap blocks.
- `#align 64` (and larger) locals are aligned in the interpreter too; they were only aligned relative to their stack frame.
- `continue`/`break` in a `for` body inserted by a `for_expansion` run the expansion's loop defers (`defer i += 1;` before `#insert body;` no longer loops forever).
- `null` binds a type variable before a defaulted baked parameter that names it (`is(null)` with `$cmp: (T, T) -> bool = null`).
- `#add_context name :: value;` is a Context constant (`#Context.name`), not a field.
- Unnamed `#library,link_always "x";` statements are linked.
- Integer sentinels cast to procedure types (`SIG_IGN`) are valid constants; the macOS `SIG_*` dispositions have the handler type, as on Linux.
- `Process`: a captured child's stdin is a socket, and `read_pipe` no longer closes a pipe at end of input.
- `String_Builder`: space ensured in the first buffer survives a reset.

### Removed

- The standalone browser playground UI (`web/scripting-runtime`, the CodeMirror editor and its npm dependencies). The hosted playground is at https://matteopolak.com/playground/jai. The browser bundle now holds `jai_wasm.wasm`, `engine.mjs` (moved to `crates/jai-wasm/js/`), `jaifmt-playground.jai`, `build-metadata.json` and a README, and its manifest is schema v2.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

The first release of `jaic`, an independent Jai compiler written in Rust.

### Downloads

| Archive | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `jaic-macos-arm64.tar.gz` | `jaic` with the LLVM backend (check, run, build), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |
| `jaic-linux-x64.tar.gz` | `jaic` with the LLVM backend (check, run, build), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |
| `jaic-windows-x64.zip` | `jaic` without a native backend (check, run), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |

Unpack the archive and run `jaic` from it. It finds the `stdlib/` folder next to the executable (or the folder in `JAIC_STDLIB`). LLVM is linked into the macOS and Linux builds, so it does not need to be installed. Native builds call the system linker: Xcode's command line tools on macOS, `cc` on Linux.

### Compiler

- Type-checks, interprets (`jaic run`) and natively builds (`jaic build`) Jai programs.
- Language: polymorphic procedures and structs, baking, `#modify`, macros, `#code`/`#insert`, custom `for_expansion`, `using`, `context`, `Any` and type info.
- Compile-time execution (`#run`) in the IR interpreter, including calls into native libraries.
- Metaprograms: the `Compiler` module's workspaces, message loop and build options.
- Arithmetic overflow and array bounds checks, stack traces.
- `#asm` for common x86-64 and arm64 instructions.
- `Bindings_Generator` for C, C++ and Objective-C headers, through libclang (loaded at run time when present).

### Standard library

An independently written standard library: `Basic`, `String`, `Hash_Table`, `File`, `Process`, `Thread`, `Math`, `Compiler`, `Bindings_Generator`, `Objective_C`, `GetRect`, `Simp`, `Window_Creation` and more. See `docs/stdlib/` in the repository.

### Tooling

- `jai-lsp`: a language server with diagnostics, type-checked hover and completion, and go to definition.
- A browser playground: the same compiler built for WebAssembly.

### Compatibility

These projects check, run or build: Focus (builds and runs on macOS), Jails, jaison, sgpu, the examples from *The Way to Jai*, and the reference `how_to` programs. Vk-Engine checks for Linux.

### Known limitations

- No native executables for Windows targets yet (no Win64 calling convention). Windows programs can be checked (`-os windows`), and the Windows build of `jaic` checks and interprets.
- No native debug information.
- `#asm` rejects string operations, division, x87 and mask registers.
