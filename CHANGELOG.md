# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The VS Code extension's display name is now *Jai Toolchain* (its ID stays `matteopolak.jai`): the VS Code Marketplace needs a display name no other extension uses, and *Jai* is taken, so 0.4.0 reached only Open VSX and the GitHub release.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Package managers and installers: `brew install matteopolak/tap/jai` (macOS arm64, Linux x86-64), `winget install matteopolak.jai` (Windows x64 and arm64), and `install.sh` (`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteopolak/jai/main/install.sh | sh`) and `install.ps1` scripts that install a release verified against its `SHA256SUMS` and upgrade in place (`JAIC_VERSION`, `JAIC_INSTALL_DIR`). Each release renders the Homebrew formula and winget manifests from its own tag and checksums, pushes the formula to the tap and opens the winget-pkgs pull request. See `docs/tools/package-managers.md`.
- A VS Code extension, `matteopolak.jai` (`editors/vscode`, attached to each release as `jai-vscode-<version>.vsix`): a TextMate grammar (directives, here-strings, `0x`/`0b`/`0h` numbers, nested comments, declarations, `$T`/`$$x`) refined by jailsp's semantic tokens, a jailsp client with jailint's findings, quick fixes and `source.fixAll.jailint`, live `jailint.toml` edits, `#insert`/`#run` expansion documents, formatting with `jaifmt` (honouring `jaifmt.toml` and its `ignore` globs, and `editor.formatOnSave`), *Jai: Run/Build/Check File*, snippets, a file icon and `jailint.toml`/`jaifmt.toml` schemas. Without a configured or `PATH` toolchain it asks before downloading the release matching its version, verified against SHA-256 checksums pinned at packaging time. Releases publish it to the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX once their tokens are configured. See `docs/tools/vscode-extension.md`.
- jailsp: help inside `#asm` blocks. Completion offers every instruction jaic accepts (general-purpose, BMI/ADX, string, SSE through AVX2, FMA, AES, PCLMUL, SHA, F16C, GFNI, AVX-512 and op-mask), each with its operand forms, the CPU feature it needs and a one-line description (`vpaddd dst: vec, a: vec, b: vec/mem (AVX2)`); in operands, the block's declared registers and the Jai variables in scope; register classes after `name:`, register names after `===`, size suffixes after `.`, and feature modifiers after `#asm`. Hover on a mnemonic shows the same, on a declared register its class, and signature help lists an instruction's forms. It works while the block is unterminated or does not parse, and in the browser playground. The list is the compiler's own instruction table, now public as `jaic::sema::asm_catalog`.
- jailsp: hovers show memory layout from the compiler's own layout data for the workspace's target: a struct, union, enum or type alias shows `size 8, align 4 (3 bytes of padding)`, a field `offset 4, size 4, align 4 (3 bytes of padding before)` (through `using`, `#as using`, `#place`, `#overlay`, member `#align` and anonymous nested structs and unions), and a variable or constant of an aggregate type its type's size and alignment. `Node(int)` shows the instance; a polymorphic definition shows none. Works in the browser build too.
- jailsp: an unknown identifier that a standard-library module declares gets an ``Add `#import "Basic";` `` quick fix, one per module the compiler suggests (preferred only when there is one), inserted after the file's imports or below its leading comments; `Math.sqrt` without an import gets `Math :: #import "Math";`. The compiler carries the suggested imports on the diagnostic (`Diagnostic::fixes.imports`).
- jailint rule `wrapping_constant` (warn): a constant that silently wraps to the type of the other operand of `/`, `%` or an ordering comparison, such as `(0xffff_ffff - 40) / h` or `h < 0x8000_0000` with `h: s32`. The help shows the value the operator really uses and suggests computing in `s64` (or `u64`).
- Browser build: `jai_play_set_styled(1)` renders errors with ANSI colour and box drawing, for output panes that draw them.
- `Build_Options.cast_bounds_check` (`.FATAL` by default, `.NONFATAL`, `.OFF`): a runtime integer cast, `cast(T)` or `xx`, to a narrower type checks that the value fits, in `jaic run`, `#run` and built executables: ``error: runtime error: cast of 300 to `u8` overflows`` with a help on `cast,trunc`/`xx,trunc` and `cast,no_check`. Casts to a type at least as wide never check. See `docs/language/casts-and-conversions.md`.
- A `#complete` switch on an enum without a default label stops the program when the value is none of the members (``no case of the `#complete` switch matches its value, 7``) instead of running no case.
- Built executables say which check failed and where before they stop: an array index out of range (with the index and count), a cast that overflows, an unmatched `#complete` switch, an integer division by zero, an `#asm` divide fault and a missing `return` print `path:line: error: <message>` through Runtime_Support's `runtime_support_check_failed`, in the interpreter's words. Before, they trapped silently.
- A crash in native code that `jaic run` or `#run` called (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL or SIGFPE; access violations and the like on Windows) names the foreign procedure, the Jai line that called it and the interpreter's call stack, and exits with status 121, instead of killing jaic without a message. Only the thread that made the foreign call is blamed (on macOS, also when the call ran on the main thread for it): a thread a C library started that crashes on its own is not reported as the interpreter's call.
- `ok:, toki.str = f();`: a mixed declaration list can assign to members, indexes and dereferences alongside the names it declares.
- Struct literals without a dot in expressions, `f({1})` and `f({.A, 1})`, which code in the upstream corpus uses.
- A mismatched `return` value gets a note pointing at the declared return type.
- `Type_Info_Struct_Member.Flags.OVERLAY`: set on members declared after `#overlay(f)`, so serializers such as toml-jai can skip them.
- `Basic.string_to_float64_new`, which returns success first (`ok, value, rest`).
- `Bindings_Generator`: `Library_Info.identifier`, the name the bindings give a library; `will_print_bindings` may change it (sgpu's Vulkan generator).
- A one-byte string constant is a `u8` in arithmetic with an integer (`c - "0"`), as a `u8` argument (`split(s, ".")`, where no `string` overload exists) and in a cast (`cast(u8, "\u001F")`), as comparisons already allowed.
- WASI builds (`jaic build -os wasm`) have files and a libm. Wasi_Runtime implements the C file calls the stdlib makes (`open`, `fopen` and the `f*` streams, `stat`, `opendir`/`readdir`, `mkdir`, `rename`, `realpath`, `getcwd`/`chdir`...) on WASI preview 1's pre-opened directories, and `tools/wasi_run.mjs` pre-opens `/` and passes `PWD`, so File, File_Utilities, Text_File_Handler and friends work under node. libm's `round`, `fma`, `floor`, `ceil`, `trunc`, `sqrt`, `fabs`, `copysign`, `fmin`, `fmax` and `fmod` are exact and `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `exp`, `exp2`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `pow`, `atan`, `atan2`, `asin` and `acos` within an ulp (with their float32 forms), and compiler-rt's binary128 helpers (`__addtf3`, `__multf3`, `__divtf3`, comparisons and conversions) make `Long_Double` work, correctly rounded. Process calls (`fork`, `pipe`, `waitpid`...) fail with errno as in a sandbox without processes. See `docs/native/wasm-target.md`.
- Stdlib runtime tests on every platform: `tools/stdlib_runtime.py` runs every stdlib test in the interpreter, natively, in the browser sandbox and as a WASI build (Windows: interpreter and native, plus every test in the MinGW cross builds), with a checked-in skip list whose entries must keep failing; `tools/stdlib_coverage.py` reports which public procedures of each module the tests run, from the new `JAIC_COVERAGE` interpreter record, and CI fails when a module's coverage drops below `tests/stdlib-coverage.txt`. `tools/wasi_run.mjs` names every import a WASI module lacks. See docs/tools/stdlib-runtime-tests.md.
- Windows: `tools/build_native_libs.py` builds FreeType (pinned 2.14.3 source archive), `stb_image`, `stb_image_write`, `stb_image_resize` and `stb_vorbis` for x64 and arm64 with Clang for the MSVC toolchain, as `<name>.lib` that `jaic build` links and `<name>.dll` that `jaic run` loads, so Simp's text, GetRect and Sound_Player work in native Windows builds. See `docs/tools/native-libs.md`.
- `jaic run` on Windows can call `snprintf`, `vsnprintf` and the rest of the `printf` family when no DLL exports them (the UCRT defines them inline in `<stdio.h>`): the interpreter forwards them to the UCRT's `__stdio_common_vsprintf`/`__stdio_common_vfprintf`, as the header does.
- `Unmapping_Allocator` on Windows, with `VirtualAlloc`, `VirtualProtect` and `VirtualFree` (retired blocks are decommitted but stay reserved, so their addresses are never reused).
- Windows CI runs the OpenGL window tests on x64 with Mesa's llvmpipe from a pinned, checksum-verified mesa-dist-win release; `tools/stdlib_runtime.py --dlls DIR` copies DLLs beside each native test program.

### Changed

- jaifmt puts a blank line between file-level items when either spans several lines (procedures with a body, structs, enums, here-strings, `#run` and `#if` blocks), and between a group of `#import`/`#load` lines and the next item. Consecutive imports and consecutive one-line declarations stay together; comments and `#scope_*` lines directly above an item stay attached to it, with the blank line above them. Items inside a file-level `#if` block count as file-level. No blank lines are removed. `blank_lines_between_items = false` in `jaifmt.toml` turns it off. The repository is reformatted accordingly.
- An unknown identifier that several modules declare names the others after the most used one (``help: other modules that declare `log`: `Math` ``), and a module's own name used as a namespace (`Math.sqrt`) suggests `Math :: #import "Math";`. Only real top-level declarations count, not struct fields that happen to be indented like them.
- `jaic build` of a program without `main` exits with status 3 instead of 1, so scripts can tell "nothing to build" from a failed compile. The browser playground's diagnostics carry a stable `code` for the errors tools react to (`unknown-identifier`, `type-mismatch`, `static-assert`, `unknown-library`, `missing-file`, `unavailable`, and `runtime-error` for a trap that stopped the running program).
- `jaic run`: other Jai threads keep running while one is inside a long C call (`read`, `accept`, a sleep in C); a thread that has been in one C call for a millisecond hands the interpreter on, and short calls still cost no switch. A `#c_call` procedure that a thread C started calls (an audio render thread) runs as a thread of the scheduler, so it can lock Jai mutexes, wait on condition variables and semaphores, join threads and sleep, instead of stopping with an error; C -> Jai -> C -> Jai nesting works on every thread. A deadlock is still reported (after a second once C may hold a Jai callback, since a thread of C's may yet wake somebody; the procedure `Thread` starts threads through does not count), and a crash in C names the call stack of the thread that made the call. See `docs/compiler/interpreter-threads.md`.
- `Bindings_Generator`: `Enum.enumerates` holds `*Declaration`s, one constant declaration per value with its `Literal` as the expression, and `Literal.enum_value` is a `*Declaration`. Visitors see the values after their enum and can drop one with `OMIT_FROM_OUTPUT`. Vk-Engine's and sgpu's Vulkan generators run; generators written for the older `Enum.Enumerate` values no longer type-check. `Library_Info.name` is now the library's file name; its Jai name moved to `identifier`.
- Error messages say what is wrong and, where jaic can tell, what to change. See `docs/compiler/diagnostics.md` for the style guide, the layouts and the exit statuses.
  - One renderer (`jaic::render`) draws diagnostics for `jaic` and `jailint`: rustc's layout with context lines, labels, `help:` lines and fix previews, in colour on a terminal (`--color auto|always|never`, `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`) and with box drawing where the terminal supports it (`JAIC_DIAGNOSTICS=plain|ascii|unicode`). Piped output keeps the `path:line:col: error: message` form, with paths relative to where jaic started.
  - Runtime errors name the check that failed (an array index outside the array, with the index and count, null dereference, division by zero...), point at the user's line, and list the call stack innermost first with standard-library frames folded and internal names hidden. A failed `assert` shows its message or its condition (``assertion failed: `x == 4` is false``), in `jaic run` and in built executables alike.
  - An unknown identifier names the module that declares it (``help: `print` is declared in the `Basic` module: add `#import "Basic";` ``), the build metaprogram that adds it, or a similar visible name. A missing module points at a nearby folder that holds it and the `-import_dir` that finds it.
  - Type and call mismatches underline the value or argument, show the declaration as a note, and suggest the conversion (`cast`, `.data`, `tprint`, `.*`, `#char`); an unknown member or parameter suggests the closest one or lists them. `#assert` failures show the condition and, for `OS`/`CPU` checks, the target being compiled for.
  - A check that fails in a `#c_call` procedure C called (a `qsort` comparator) says where (`path:line:col`) and which procedures it was in, instead of a bare line and column.
  - A metaprogram's own error (`compiler_report`, a workspace marked as failed) is shown at the place it names, without the compile-time-execution prefix.
  - Names and tokens in messages are quoted with backticks (`` `x` ``) rather than single quotes.
  - Command lines: `jaic` and `jailsp` take `--help` and `--version`, `jailint` and `jaifmt` `--help`; all four suggest the closest command, option or rule for a typo, and exit with 2 for a command-line mistake. `jaic` explains an unwritable output, a missing linker, a link failure (missing library or symbol), a program without `main` and an unknown library. `jailint` and `jaifmt` report config mistakes as ``in `path`, line N: ...`` with the fix, and `jaifmt` errors use the `error:`/`help:` form with `--color`. `jailsp` run from a terminal explains that an editor starts it.
  - `jaic check` words its warning about workspace output it does not write as ``warning: `jaic check` does not write build/game (workspace `Build` asks for an executable)`` with ``help: `jaic build first.jai` (or `jaic run first.jai`) writes it``.

### Fixed

- Compile-time code that runs while `compiler_get_nodes` exports a tree with names and types (a pending `#insert` that resolving a name expands, itself calling `compiler_get_nodes`) no longer gets syntax-tree and type structs of unrelated records, which crashed the compiler or the language server: its records were numbered from 1 again, and `Compiler` builds each record's struct once by id.
- The playground's execution budget (and jailsp's and jailint's) now covers the compile-time code of workspaces a metaprogram compiles. A workspace's compiler had no budget in the playground, so an endless `#run` in a program a metaprogram compiled hung it, and jailsp and jailint gave each workspace a fresh budget, so a metaprogram creating many of them was not bounded.
- jailsp: go to definition on a builtin constant such as `OS` no longer crashes the server; it has no declaration to go to.
- A statement starting with `ifx` no longer takes time exponential in how deeply `ifx` statements nest inside its condition or branches (a 2.5 KB file of nested `{ifx` hung the parser): it was parsed once as an assigning `if` and again as an expression.
- An unknown escape of a multibyte character in a string (`"\é"`, or of a byte that is not UTF-8, which reads as U+FFFD) no longer crashes the compiler while it reports the error: the error's span ended inside the character. The message names the whole character.
- WASI modules no longer export every Wasi_Runtime function: only `_start` is exported, so `wasm-ld` drops what a program never calls and a hello world imports four WASI calls instead of every one the runtime uses.
- Threads in the browser playground and under `jaic run -os wasm` no longer hang or end in a false deadlock when one waits for more work: the sandbox ran a started thread to completion on top of the thread that blocked, and gave up for good on one that waited while the thread below it could go on, so a worker waiting on a semaphore for its next request (`File_Async`, `Thread_Group` work added later) never served it. Every thread now keeps its own value stack and a blocked thread is suspended, its interpreted frames saved, and resumed when another thread signals it however long it waited; time passes on the virtual clock only when no thread can run, and a wait no thread can end is still reported as `deadlock: every thread is blocked`. `tests/stdlib/file-async.jai` now runs in the playground too.
- The macOS release's `jaic` linked Homebrew's `libzstd.1.dylib`, so it did not start on a Mac without Homebrew's zstd; it now links zstd statically, and the release check that should have caught it (`! otool -L ... | grep`, which `set -e` ignores) now fails the build.
- `jaic run` on macOS no longer wakes its main thread every 5 ms while it waits for the program to finish: it blocks until the interpreter thread sends a foreign call to run or ends. When two threads crash in native code at once, the one that does not write the report sleeps until jaic exits instead of spinning a CPU core.
- `#asm` rejects `punpckl*`/`punpckh*` spellings other than `bw`, `wd`, `dq` and `qdq` (`punpcklb`, `punpckhwq`) as unsupported instructions; they were taken as a narrower interleave.
- On Intel Macs, `#system_library` names installed by Homebrew (in `/usr/local/lib`, such as FreeType for Simp and GetRect) are found by `jaic run`, `#run` and the native link, as `/opt/homebrew/lib` already was on Apple silicon.
- `Simp.deinit_fonts` no longer reads freed memory when more than one font is live: it freed each font's record before deinitializing the next font, whose record lookup walks them all.
- `jaic run` on Windows hands the program its own arguments: `get_command_line_arguments` re-reads the command line through `GetCommandLineW`, which returned `jaic`'s, so the program saw `run` and its source file as arguments (and `c_thread_callbacks_block_on_jai_threads` took the wrong branch).
- A game that sets `context.allocator = temp` and resets temporary storage every frame no longer corrupts or hangs `Input`, `Simp`, `GetRect`, `Sound_Player` and `Window_Creation`. Their long-lived state (Input's event queues, resize and move records and per-window states; Simp's window records, drawing state, fonts, glyph pages and pending screenshots; GetRect's widget states, their text and its frame lists; Sound_Player's streams, block caches and device list; the window registries) took the caller's allocator on first growth and pointed at reclaimed memory after the reset. It now always comes from the default heap. Dropped-file names are freed with their array's allocator.
- Compiled programs no longer corrupt the stack when a procedure takes a struct smaller than a pointer: the debug-info prologue stored the incoming pointer into the parameter's copy, 8 bytes into a smaller slot, which crashed Windows x64 programs on return.
- `Tagged_Union.isa` returns a pointer into the caller's union again, so writes through it stick: it is now a macro, since parameters are copied on entry and the pointer pointed into that copy.
- A procedure that changes a struct or string parameter (`advance(*s, 1)`, `p.a += 1`) changes its own copy: before, it changed the caller's variable, in `jaic run`, `#run` and built executables.
- A `$$` parameter whose argument is omitted bakes its constant default, so `#if must` works in the body of `skip :: (p: *$T, $$must := false)` called as `skip(p)`.
- A `#modify` block on a procedure without polymorph variables (`foo :: (x: int) #modify { ... }`) or on a struct without parameters is an error at the block, whether or not it is used: before, the block was silently ignored and never even checked. The help suggests baking the parameter (`$x: int`) when that was the intent.
- A struct literal's `null` (`U.{p = null}`) clears what a union member's default (`s: string = "default"`) put in the same storage.
- `using g;` of a global `g: *S` at file scope no longer reports "struct `S` contains itself" while `S`'s field types are resolved.
- `FormatFloat` and `FormatInt` print variants of variants (`#type,isa` of a `#type,distinct float64`) instead of `<non-float>`.
- `Debug.is_valid_pointer` on Windows asks VirtualQuery whether the page is committed and readable instead of calling `IsBadReadPtr`, whose deliberate access violation stopped `jaic run` (and any debugger or crash handler watching first-chance faults).
- Atomics, Relative_Pointers and Socket wrap on purpose where they narrow, so the new cast checks no longer stop them: `atomic_decrement` and `atomic_add` of a negative amount on unsigned types, `atomic_xor`, relative pointers with negative offsets, macOS `htons`/`htonl`, and `FD_SET`, `FD_CLR` and `FD_ISSET` for descriptor 31 of a mask word.
- `jaic run`: a `#c_call` procedure stored in memory C reads (a struct field such as `AURenderCallbackStruct.inputProc` or `WNDCLASSEXW.lpfnWndProc`, a global, an array) is now a real C function pointer, not an interpreter-internal value C crashed calling. C may call it from its own threads (an audio render thread); the call waits until the interpreter is inside a foreign call. Jai code calling the stored pointer, and comparing it with the procedure, still works.
- `Clipboard`: `os_clipboard_set_bitmap` no longer fails for every bitmap on Windows, macOS and Linux. Its overflow check divided a wrapped `0xffff_ffff - 40` (`-41` as an `s32`) by the height; found by `wrapping_constant`.
- `#asm` instructions whose destination is a general-purpose register (`pmovmskb.x found:, v;`, `movmskps`, `cvttsd2si`, `pextrq`) accept a register declared in the destination, in the interpreter and LLVM alike.
- Enum members written `A : :5` parse.
- `Bindings_Generator`: an enum value whose expression a visitor replaced is printed from that expression, and one left without a printable value is logged and left out, instead of being written as `0`.
- `print(..., code_to_string(compiler_get_code(root)))` in `#run` no longer reruns the compile-time code until it exhausts memory: reparsing the same code for an export request reuses its id.
- The assertion and check reports of built executables show paths relative to the directory the build ran in, like `jaic run`.
- `jaifmt --check` prints the files it would change relative to the current directory.
- `jailint` given a file that a module's `module.jai` loads (`jailint stdlib/Compiler/workspace.jai`) checks it as part of that module, so the module's exported procedures are no longer reported as unused.
- `File_Async.initialize_queue` no longer tests the result of `Thread.init` on its condition variables, which returns nothing; any program importing `File_Async` failed to compile.
- Timed waits on a `Thread.Semaphore` on Windows last at least the requested time: they measured it with the 15.6 ms `GetTickCount64` clock and returned on the first early timeout.
- `jaic run` on Windows x64 passes up to 24 arguments to foreign procedures (was 20).
- `Input.set_custom_cursor_handling` takes effect: by default the arrow is restored as the pointer moves over Input's windows (Windows' class cursor, and now the macOS and X11 pumps too), and with `true` Input leaves the program's cursor alone, including Windows' `WM_SETCURSOR` reset. It used to set a flag nothing read.
- stb_image always links libm on Linux, which its decoder calls (`pow`, `ldexp`), so programs using it link when nothing else needs libm.
- GetRect on Linux sets X11 stock cursors instead of asserting that the program installed a cursor provider, so GetRect programs no longer stop at the end of their first frame there; targets without stock cursors ignore cursor requests.
- Bindings_Generator binds C++ functions to their Microsoft-mangled names (`?Button@Gui@@...`) when generating for Windows; it only recognized Itanium (`_Z`) names, so Windows bindings named symbols the DLL does not export.
- `Clipboard.os_clipboard_get_text` on Windows returns a heap string the caller owns, as on macOS and Linux; it returned temporary storage, so freeing it failed.
- The GetRect color animation editor no longer fails a bounds check as soon as it has keyframes (`get_sorted_keyframes` indexed an array after zeroing its count).
- `Simp.set_window_dimensions` no longer asserts when called before a shader is bound; it resizes the render target and resets the projection as `update_window` does.
- `Clipboard.set_bitmap` on Windows accepts bitmaps again: its size check computed the 32-bit DIB limit in `s32`, which wrapped and rejected every image.
- `jaic run` on Linux finds system libraries installed only under their versioned names (`libatomic.so.1` without the development package), so `Atomics.compare_and_swap2` runs in the interpreter.
- WASI builds' `nanosleep` (and so `sleep_milliseconds`) sleeps until the monotonic clock reaches the deadline: Node can end a WASI poll a few microseconds early.
- Input on Linux reports a new window's size when it is mapped: without a window manager (Xvfb, some kiosks) X11 sends no ConfigureNotify for a new window, so programs never learned its size.
- `GL.nsgl_create_context` on macOS falls back to the software renderer when no hardware renderer offers the pixel format, so Simp windows open in virtual machines (CI runners).
- Native builds on Linux link built library archives (`libstb_vorbis.a`...) before libraries named with `-l`, so an archive that calls libm links even when `-lm` was declared first and the linker drops unneeded libraries (`--as-needed`).
- `System.get_number_of_processors(.ALL_PHYSICAL)` on Linux no longer reports more cores than logical processors when `/sys` lists CPUs the process cannot use (the WASM sandbox reads the host's `/sys` but reports one processor).
- Input on Windows reports window resizes and close-button QUIT events: windows created by Window_Creation now use a window procedure that feeds Input, so messages Windows sends directly (WM_SIZE, WM_CLOSE) are no longer lost, and closing a window no longer destroys it before the program sees QUIT.
- Compiler on Windows: relative `import_path` entries are anchored with the calling file's own separator (`C:\game\mods`), not a mix of `\` and `/`.
- Print_Vars compiles with jaic and no longer frees names that live in constant data (a crash with "pointer is not owned by this allocator heap").
- Jai_Lexer: `<<<`, `>>>` and `=>` are single tokens, the `` escape is recognised, and `1_000.5` lexes as one float (it lexed as 1).
- Math: `sqrt` is correctly rounded (about 30% of results were an ulp off), `round` handles values just below one half and near 2^52, `pow` with a whole exponent is exact where the result is representable (`pow(2, 10)` gave 1023.9999999999998), and the `FLOAT64_*`, `PI64` and `TAU64` constants are float64 (`is_finite(FLOAT64_MAX)` was false).
- Basic: `string_to_float` and `string_to_float64` round correctly ("0.3" gave 0.30000000000000004; `1e-6`, the smallest normal and the largest double were off or 0).
- String: `parse_int` into a narrow type fails on out-of-range text ("256" as `u8` gave 0 with success); `path_decomp` of `..` or `a/..` keeps the name instead of returning "."; `atof` works in WASI builds (Jai code there; the link failed for want of `env.atof`).
- `jaic build`: `compare_and_swap` on `float32` and `float64` compiles (it failed with "expected an integer, found FloatValue"); the swap compares and returns the float's bits.
- WASI builds (`jaic build -os wasm`): Wasi_Runtime provides `localtime_r`, `gmtime_r` (UTC), `gettimeofday`, `nanosleep`, `getcwd`/`chdir` (the root only), `errno` and single-threaded `pthread` mutex, condition and thread calls (starting a thread fails cleanly), so programs using Basic's calendar, sleeping, the working directory or a mutex link.
- Remap_Context works: the first thread's context now records its type (`context_info`), which `remap_context` checks; it asserted "invalid foreign context".
- GL on Linux: `gl_load` loads the OpenGL 1.1 procedures (`glDrawArrays`, `glBindTexture`, `glGenTextures`...), which are procedure fields there; they stayed null, so Simp crashed on its first draw.
- stb_vorbis on Linux: programs that decode Vorbis link; the codec needs libm, which the module declared but never linked.
- Zip_File_Directory: `load_zip_directory` of a missing archive fails without creating an empty file.
- System on Linux: `get_number_of_processors(.ALL_PHYSICAL)` falls back to the logical count where `/sys` has no CPU topology (containers, the browser sandbox) instead of returning 0.
- Process: `run_command` with captured output closes the child's input, so a program that reads stdin (`sort`) ends instead of waiting forever; on POSIX, a missing `working_directory` is named in the error instead of blaming the program.
- File on macOS and Linux: a handle opened `for_writing` can read back what it wrote, `keep_existing_content` starts at the end but writes where the program seeks (as on Windows; append mode sent every write to the end), and opening a directory for reading fails (on tmpfs `read_entire_file` of a directory returned an empty string).
- Browser sandbox (`jaic run -os wasm`): `errno` keeps the last error (reading it reset it to 0), `strerror` works, hard links share their contents, and `stat` reports distinct inode numbers and a modification time that advances with each change. `same_file` thought any two files were the same, so `copy_file` refused to overwrite, and File_Watcher missed edits that kept a file's size.
- BuildCpp on Windows: MSVC builds find `cl.exe`, `lib.exe` and the versioned Windows SDK folders, and link for the host CPU (arm64 too); every build failed, looking for `cl.exe` inside the path of `link.exe` and for SDK libraries in the kit root. BuildCpp errors outside a metaprogram are logged instead of dropped.
- Debug on Windows: `backtrace`, `backtrace_symbols` (module and offset per frame), `enable_signal_handler` and `disable_signal_handler` work; they stopped the build with "Native stack capture is not implemented for this target". `is_valid_pointer` compiles there (the Windows module lacked `IsBadReadPtr`) and works on macOS and Linux too.
- Windows cross builds with MinGW: system libraries named with capitals (`#system_library "Gdi32"`, as the Windows module does) link; the toolchain's import libraries are lowercase, so Simp and Window_Creation programs failed to link.
- Windows, `jaic build`: `#elsewhere` variables of a system DLL (a `#system_library` other than the C runtime) link. A DLL exports a variable only through its `__imp_` pointer, which the build now follows; the link failed with an undefined symbol.
- Windows, `jaic run`: `long double` math functions such as `sqrtl` and `fmaxl` resolve to their `double` forms, which they are on Windows; the C runtime exports no `l` names, so such calls failed.
- Bindings_Generator on Windows: drive-rooted source paths such as `/tmp/x.h` are found; clang looked for them next to its in-memory include file.
- Windows: `jaic run` and `jaic build` no longer give programs a `\\?\` verbatim working directory and `#file`. Drive-rooted paths such as `/tmp/x` then named no folder (writing them failed under `jaic run`), and `#import` paths anchored at `#file` did not resolve.
- macOS arm64, `jaic run`: foreign calls and C callbacks with arguments narrower than 8 bytes past the argument registers (a `BOOL` or `u16` after eight integer arguments, as in `+[NSEvent keyEventWithType:...]`) work. Apple's ABI packs those stack arguments at their own size; the interpreter refused such calls and read such callbacks' arguments from the wrong offsets.
- Calls of a procedure with a baked variadic parameter (`$args: ..Code`, `$types: ..Type`) get their own instance per argument list. Lists of the same length shared the first call's instance, so `show(A); show(G);` ran `A`'s code twice.
- A baked variadic `Code` parameter (`$args: ..Code`) quotes each argument expression like a single `$c: Code` does, so `print_vars(alpha, alpha + 1)` and the rest of Print_Vars work with locals. Such calls failed with "cannot use local 'alpha' in a compile-time expression".
- Structs with a variadic parameter (`Holder :: struct(types: ..Type)`) can be instantiated: the arguments bind one constant `[] Type` and key the instance, so `Tagged_Union` works. `Holder(s64, string)` reported "too many arguments" and `Holder(s64)` bound a single `Type`.
- Metaprograms see `.VARARGS` in a variadic parameter's `type_inst.inst_flags`, so the Check module accepts @PrintLike procedures. Every one was reported as missing a format string before its varargs.
- An untyped 16-digit `0h` literal (`0h7FEFFFFF_FFFFFFFF`) is `float64`; an 8-digit one stays `float32`. The long form defaulted to `float32`, so `x := 0h7FEFFFFF_FFFFFFFF` became inf, `0h00100000_00000000` became 0 and overloads picked `float32`.
- `push_context,defer_pop;` without a context is an error ("'push_context,defer_pop' needs the context to push"). It compiled, and changes the block made to `context` leaked out of it.
- `jaic run -os wasm` and the browser no longer start a pending thread while the running thread holds a mutex or spin lock: the new thread blocked on the lock and was abandoned, losing its work, or spun forever. Pending threads now get a turn when a thread polls (a failed or no-op `compare_and_swap`, a busy `trylock`) instead of after a fixed number of basic blocks, so `threads-synchronization`, `threads-group-work` and `threads-allocators` pass there every time.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- CI type-checks every stdlib module with `-no_dce` for linux, macos, windows and wasm (`crates/jaic-cli/tests/stdlib_targets.rs`, expectations in `tests/stdlib-targets.txt`), so a type error in code for another platform or in a procedure nothing calls fails the build. See `docs/tools/stdlib-target-check.md`.
- CI checks every Objective-C selector the stdlib sends: it must take as many arguments as it is sent with (one per `:`), and on macOS the class or protocol must have the method in the runtime (`crates/jaic-cli/tests/objc_selectors.rs`, known gaps in `tests/objc-selectors.txt`). See `docs/tools/objc-selector-check.md`.
- `JAIC_MEMORY_LIMIT=<bytes|nK|nM|nG>`: an exact cap on what `jaic` allocates (compiler, interpreter and the program's C `malloc` calls). Crossing it prints `error: memory limit of N MiB exceeded` and exits with status 120. The corpus sweep uses it for `--memory-limit` instead of sampling resident memory.
- `jailint`, a linter for Jai whose rules run on the type-checked program. The rules are `index_only_loop`, `manual_index_counter`, `unused_variable`, `unused_parameter`, `unused_import`, `redundant_cast`, `bool_comparison`, `format_arg_count`, `shadowed_it`, `defer_in_loop`, `float_equality` (off by default) and `lossy_xx` (off by default).
  - Diagnostics are printed in rustc's layout. `--fix` applies the safe fixes, `-A`/`-W`/`-D` set levels, and the exit status is non-zero when a `deny` rule fires.
  - Settings come from `jailint.toml` (levels and excluded paths). Findings can be suppressed with `// jailint: allow(rule)`, `// jailint: allow-file(rule)` or `@jailint_allow(rule)`.
  - Workspaces a `build.jai` metaprogram creates are linted too.
  - Release archives and the Nix package include `jailint`, and CI lints the repository's Jai code with it. See `docs/tools/jailint.md`.
- jailint rules for likely bugs: `absurd_comparison` (`u >= 0` on an unsigned value), `almost_swapped`, `bitwise_precedence` (operators that group unlike C, `1 << n - 1`), `duplicate_condition`, `erasing_op`, `identical_branches`, `identical_operands`, `infinite_loop` (a `while` whose condition nothing changes), `integer_division_in_float`, `min_max`, `no_effect`, `range_past_count` (`for i: 0..xs.count` indexing `xs[i]`), `remove_in_for`, `reversed_range`, `self_assignment` and `unused_result` (`trim(line);`); and for unidiomatic code: `identity_op`, `manual_assign_op` and `needless_bool`. All `warn` by default. Each rule has its own section in `docs/tools/jailint.md`.
- `jailsp`: lint fixes are preferred quick fixes that carry their diagnostic and the rule (`data.rule`), with sentence-case titles; `source.fixAll.jailint` applies every safe fix at once; diagnostics link to their rule's docs (`codeDescription`); code action requests honour `context.only` and `context.diagnostics`; an open `jailint.toml` (sent with `didOpen`, as the browser build does) configures the lints of the documents below it.
- `jailsp` publishes jailint's findings as diagnostics (the rule as the code, `jailint` as the source) and offers their fixes as quick-fix code actions. It reuses the compile that hover and inlay hints already use.
- `jaic::build::WorkspaceObserver` lets embedders see each workspace's compiler.
- Release binaries (`jaic`, `jailsp`, `jailint`) are built with profile-guided optimisation on every platform except Windows arm64, where the profile runtime does not work, and the Linux ones are further optimised with BOLT. `tools/build_pgo.py` builds them the same way locally. See `docs/tools/pgo-and-bolt.md`.
- `#asm` accepts the F16C, SHA and GFNI extensions: `vcvtph2ps`/`vcvtps2ph` (all imm8 rounding modes, NaNs, subnormals and overflow as on hardware; MXCSR rounding is round-to-nearest), `sha1rnds4`, `sha1nexte`, `sha1msg1`, `sha1msg2`, `sha256rnds2` (`xmm0` as an explicit last operand), `sha256msg1`, `sha256msg2`, and `gf2p8mulb`, `gf2p8affineqb`, `gf2p8affineinvqb` in legacy, VEX and EVEX (masked, broadcast) forms. Like the rest of `#asm` they run on any host CPU.
- Windows x64: C code can call back into `#c_call` procedures running in the interpreter (`jaic run`, `#run`), with the Microsoft x64 convention: arguments by position in RCX/RDX/R8/R9 or XMM0-XMM3, the stack after them, aggregates that are not 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes by pointer, and large results through the hidden pointer.
- Windows: programs that start threads run in the interpreter. `CreateThread`, waits on thread, semaphore and event handles, critical sections, SRW locks, condition variables, `Sleep` and `SwitchToThread` go through the cooperative thread scheduler.
- MSVC builds write a PDB next to the executable or DLL (`<name>.pdb`) when debug information is on.

- `jaic build -os wasm` compiles to a wasm64 (Memory64) WASI module linked with `wasm-ld`; `-target wasm64-unknown-unknown` leaves out the runtime so the host supplies the imports. See `docs/native/wasm-target.md`.
  - Metaprograms target it with `os_target = .WASM`, `cpu_target = .CUSTOM` and `llvm_options.target_system_triple`/`_cpu`/`_features`; `additional_linker_arguments` go to `wasm-ld`.
  - `#foreign` procedures and `#elsewhere` globals become wasm imports (module `env` without a library, else the library's name), and `#program_export` procedures are exported.
  - `stdlib/Wasi_Runtime`, written in Jai, provides `_start`, the heap, stdio, the environment and the clock on WASI preview 1; jaic adds it when the triple names WASI.
  - `wasm-ld` comes from `JAIC_WASM_LD`, the LLVM install or an LLD package (`lld`, `lld-23`). wasm32 is refused.
- `#intrinsic "llvm.<name>"` on a bodiless procedure calls that LLVM intrinsic in native builds.
- `jaifmt.wasm`: jaifmt compiled to WebAssembly (`jaifmt/wasm.jai`): source on stdin, `--config <toml>` or `JAIFMT_CONFIG`, result on stdout. Browser bundles include it (`build_scripting_wasm.py --jaic`, required by `package_browser_release.py`). It formats about 35 times faster than the interpreted playground driver, and CI checks its output against native jaifmt on every golden case.
- `jaifmt/build.jai`: `jaic build jaifmt/build.jai` builds an optimised `target/jaifmt` through the Compiler module; `- wasm` builds `target/jaifmt.wasm` and `- -o <file>` picks the output.
- `tools/jaic-diff.py` has a `wasm-native` backend, and `tools/wasi_run.mjs` runs WASI modules under node.
- `Build_Options.dead_code_elimination` and `-no_dce`: `.MODULES_ONLY` (the default) type-checks everything declared in the program's own files, `.NONE` modules too, `.ALL` only what the program reaches. See `docs/language/dead-code-elimination.md`.
- `jailsp` publishes the type checker's first error as a `jai-check` diagnostic, and checks metaprograms that create workspaces.

- Release archives include `jaifmt` (`jaifmt.exe` on Windows), built by the release's `jaic` with `-O2`.

### Changed

- The `jaifmt` program moved from `tools/jaifmt/` to a top-level `jaifmt/` directory, since `tools/` holds repository-maintenance scripts: build it with `jaic build jaifmt/main.jai -O2 -o target/jaifmt`. The formatter library is still `stdlib/Jai_Format`, and the browser bundle's `jaifmt-playground.jai` and `jaifmt.wasm` keep their names.
- The program's own files are type-checked whether or not anything uses them, like the official compiler's default dead-code elimination. A global, constant or procedure body nothing references used to go unchecked, so programs with errors there compiled. A `#run` inside such a body now runs. Imported modules are unchanged: their unreferenced bodies stay unchecked. Compiled output still contains only what the program reaches, and `jaic build` now also drops code that only compile-time checking lowered.
- Casts no longer push their type into the operand: `cast(float32) (0 - w)` with `w: u16 = 15` subtracts in `u16` (`65521`) and then converts, where it used to compute `-15` in `float32`. Likewise an untyped literal operand takes the other operand's type rather than a declaration's or parameter's (`f: float32 = 0 - w;`). Code that relied on the old float arithmetic needs the cast on the operand: `cast(float32) 0 - w`.
- LLVM 23: the native backend is built against LLVM 23.1 (llvm-sys 231, Inkwell from a pinned commit of its main branch until a crates.io release supports LLVM 23). Building from source needs LLVM 23 and `LLVM_SYS_231_PREFIX` instead of `LLVM_SYS_221_PREFIX`; release archives, CI and the Nix flake use LLVM 23. The `-unroll-add-parallel-reductions=false` workaround for LLVM 22's miscompiled `sub` reductions is gone, since 23.1.0 fixes the unroller.
- `tools/check_dependency_age.py` accepts git dependencies pinned to a full commit hash on GitHub that is at least 14 days old.
- Every `tests/stdlib` program must pass in the browser engine; CI and the browser release fail otherwise. Tests skip what the WASM target lacks (processes, native libraries, windows) themselves, and `tools/playground_stdlib_expected.json` is gone.

### Fixed

- Under `jaic run`, `get_path_of_running_executable` returns the executable `jaic build` would write for the program (`src/main` for `jaic run src/main.jai`) instead of `jaic`'s own path, so programs that load data relative to their executable (`../assets`) find it.
- `jaic run` writes the executables and libraries a metaprogram's workspaces ask for, as `jaic build` does (it only interprets the top-level program instead of compiling it), so `jaic run first.jai` on a build script builds and can launch its program. `-no_workspace_output` skips them. `jaic check` still writes nothing, and now warns when a workspace asks for output, naming the `jaic build` command that writes it.
- `Process.create_process` (and so `run_command`) logs why a program could not be started (`could not start "./build/game": No such file or directory`) instead of failing silently.
- macOS `Input`: a click no longer quits the program, and closing a window does. The adapter watched every window in `NSApp.windows` and queued `QUIT` when one went away, but AppKit adds and drops windows of its own; closed windows were never released, so they never went away. It now follows only the windows `Window_Creation` made (`Window_Type.macos_program_windows`) and queues `QUIT` when one is no longer visible without being minimized.
- macOS: `NSEvent.keyRepeatDelay`, `keyRepeatInterval` and `pressedMouseButtons` are class methods, as in AppKit; they were sent to an event and stopped the program. `swapBuffers` moved from `LightweightRenderingView` to `LightweightOpenGLView`, the only view that has an OpenGL context.
- `jaic check -os wasm` and `jaic run -os wasm` set `CPU` to `.CUSTOM`, as `jaic build -os wasm` and the browser do; they kept the host's CPU, so the same program saw `.X64` on one machine and `.ARM64` on another.
- macOS `Input.get_input_pointer_position` sent `convertPointToScreen` without its `:` and stopped the program.
- `Input`: `update_window_events` installs the platform event adapter, which nothing installed before: programs got no window events, and on macOS the window never appeared.
- Type errors in stdlib code that was never checked, found by the new stdlib target check: the macOS input adapter, `Window_Creation.toggle_fullscreen` on macOS (`NSWindow.screen` was missing), the x11 adapter's text input, `Foundation`/`Metal` return types that named `NSDictionary` without parameters, `File` known folders on Windows, `Socket` addresses on Windows, `GL` info logs, `Simp` font cleanup, `GetRect` color strips, text hit-testing and Windows cursors, `ImGui.CreateContext`, `Text_File_Handler.file_to_table`, the Vulkan, d3d, dxc and nvtt wrappers, `pl_mpeg`, `rpmalloc`, `Thekla_Atlas`, `Shared_Memory_Channel` on Windows and `POSIX_old`.
- `File.read_entire_file(path, zero_terminated := false, log_errors := true)` takes `zero_terminated` like the official module; a second positional argument meant `log_errors` before.
- `Objective_C`, `macos` and `Metal` stop with an `#assert` off Apple platforms instead of an unknown identifier.
- A struct constant that names a member of its struct (`size_of(type_of(info))`) no longer fails with a circular dependency when the struct is declared inside another struct and nothing uses it.
- An enum member's value may name the enum itself (`B :: A + cast(E) 50`).
- Compile-time pointer constants with the top bit set (`cast(HKEY) cast(s32) 0x80000000`) keep their value instead of failing with `a compile-time value holds a pointer to memory of unknown size`.
- A release `jaic` (and `jailint`, `jailsp`) started through a symlink, e.g. unpacked into `/opt` and linked from a bin folder, now finds the `stdlib` folder next to the real file. On macOS it looked next to the link and then fell back to the CI runner's path (`could not read file /Users/runner/work/jai/jai/stdlib/Preload.jai`). A missing standard library is now reported as such, with how to fix it.
- An omitted argument binds a polymorphic type its default determines: `error :: (code: int, platform_code: $T = 0)` called as `error(3)` makes `T` `s64` instead of failing with "could not infer polymorphic type".
- `Basic.create_heap` no longer passes an `Allocator_Caps` value to `assert`'s `bool` parameter (found with `-no_dce`).
- `jaic run` on a file without `main` that has `#program_export` procedures runs its compile-time code and exits 0 instead of asking for an exported `main`.
- Windows: `file_open(for_writing = true)` handles can also read, as on POSIX, so `Zip_File_Directory.load_zip_directory` works there.
- Windows release and `windows-native` CI builds link the official LLVM 23 archive again: `tools/windows-llvm/prepare.sh` supplies the zlib, zstd and libxml2 libraries its `llvm-config` names and turns zstd's absolute build-machine path, which llvm-sys could not pass to rustc, into a library name.
- The browser engine's sandbox implements `chmod`/`fchmod`, so `MacOS_Bundler` runs there.
- Standard library: unused variables and imports removed, a shadowed `it` in `Compiler` named, and index loops in `Basic` and `Math` turned into element loops (found by jailint).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- `jailsp`: macro, `#insert`, `#run` and `#if` expansions on hover and as documents, inlay hints (inferred types, parameter names where parameters share a type, `#run` values), format-string checks and hovers, `#import`/`#load` links, references, rename, signature help, folding, code lenses for polymorph instances, workspace symbols and type definitions.
- A language tour (`examples/tour/`) that the browser playground opens by default.
- Fuzzing: cargo-fuzz targets for the lexer, parser, checker, interpreter, generated programs and the language server, with nightly CI and a regression replay on every push.
- A C ABI check compares the stdlib's hand-written system bindings with the real C headers on every CI host (sizes, alignment, field offsets, constants).
- `jaic --timings` prints wall time per compile phase; `tools/compile_bench.py` benchmarks compile times on real projects.
- Native Windows executables (x86-64): `jaic build` on Windows writes `.exe`/`.dll`/`.lib` files using the Microsoft x64 calling convention, linked with clang (or `lld-link`/`link.exe`) against the MSVC runtime. From macOS and Linux, `jaic build file.jai -os windows` cross-compiles with MinGW-w64; `-target <triple>` picks any LLVM triple. The Windows archive now includes the LLVM backend. See `docs/native/windows.md`.
- Windows on arm64: `jaic build` on an arm64 Windows host writes arm64 executables, DLLs and libraries (MSVC runtime, via clang or `lld-link`), and `jaic build file.jai -os windows -cpu arm64` cross-compiles from macOS and Linux with llvm-mingw (`-target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` or `aarch64-w64-mingw32` also work). C calls follow AAPCS64 with the Windows variadic rule (every argument of a variadic call in general registers, no float-aggregate treatment). The interpreter there calls C libraries, including variadic ones, and C can call back into interpreted `#c_call` procedures. `Windows.jai` declares the arm64 `CONTEXT`. Releases include a `windows-arm64` archive. `-cpu x64|arm64` is new; `-os windows` alone still means x64 when cross-compiling.
- Windows runtime: UTF-8 command-line arguments, a crash handler that prints the exception and a backtrace, and `#program_export` procedures exported from DLLs.
- The interpreter on Windows loads DLLs and calls foreign procedures (`#run`, `jaic run` and metaprograms that use C libraries). Callbacks from C into interpreted code are not supported there yet.
- Native debug information: `jaic build` emits DWARF (a `.dSYM` next to the executable on macOS) with source lines, procedure names and typed locals, parameters and globals, so lldb and gdb can set breakpoints by `file.jai:line`, step and print variables. On by default; `--no-debug-info` or `Build_Options.emit_debug_info = .NONE` turns it off.
- `#asm`: division (`div`/`idiv`, trapping like hardware), widening (`cqo`, `cdqe`, ...), string instructions with `rep_`/`repe_`/`repne_` prefixes and the direction flag, `shld`/`shrd`, `rcl`/`rcr`, BMI1/BMI2, `adcx`/`adox`, `crc32`, the parity flag, `lahf`/`sahf`, `xlat` and `cmpxchg8b`/`cmpxchg16b`.
- `#asm`: AVX-512 op-mask registers (`omr`) with the `k*` instructions, compares into masks, merge/zero masking on every vector instruction and masked stores.
- `#asm`: a much wider SIMD set: saturating and horizontal arithmetic, FMA, shuffles, permutes, blends, unpacks, inserts/extracts, packs, conversions, compress/expand, ternary logic, scatter, AES and `pclmulqdq`. SSE–AVX2 results were checked against x86-64 hardware; AVX-512 has hand-computed tests.
- `#asm` accepts every CPUID feature name as a modifier (`#asm AVX512_VBMI`, `GFNI`, ...).
- `Bindings_Generator` matches the reference module's public API and output: system types are referred to by name, unnamed parameters become `unknownN`, comments are placed before or after a declaration like the reference, `extern "C"` blocks are walked, packed members get `#align`, and macros that reference enum constants are dropped or rewritten. The generators shipped with the reference modules (Curl, lz4, stb, POSIX, Socket, nvtt, macho, CoreFoundation) run under `jaic` and their output type checks.
- `Bindings_Generator`: C++ virtual bases (own vtable pointer, base placed at clang's offset, offset checks) and renamed overloads that are equal in Jai, with `/*const reference*/` comments.
- `Bindings_Generator`: `Block_X_literal` constructors turn Jai `#c_call` procedures into Objective-C blocks (`objc_make_block` and `objc_block_user_data` in `Objective_C`).
- `Bindings_Generator`: with `use_jaic_long_double = false`, 16-byte `long double` members keep their layout as `[16] u8` and functions passing one are stripped with a log line; Objective-C methods passing one (including the x86-64 `objc_msgSend_fpret` case) are always stripped. Printf wrappers are made for any variadic whose last argument is a `char *`.
- `Jaic_Extensions`, a module for jaic-only, non-standard features. Its first is `Long_Double` (`#jaic_type long_double`): C's `long double` with the target's format (x87 80-bit on x86-64 SysV and MinGW, binary128 on arm64 Linux and wasm32, `float64` on Apple arm64 and MSVC). Arithmetic, comparisons and casts run at full precision (native LLVM types in builds, a soft-float in the interpreter that matches x87 hardware bit for bit), and it is passed by the C ABI through `#foreign` and `#c_call`. `print` shows it through `float64`. See `docs/language/jaic-extensions.md`.
- `Bindings_Generator`: `use_jaic_long_double` (default on) binds functions using a 16-byte `long double` with `Long_Double` instead of stripping them.
- `Toolchains`: Android NDK helpers and the macOS SDK path; `Compiler` gains a default minimum macOS version.
- `jaifmt`, a Jai code formatter written in Jai: the `Jai_Format` stdlib module (`format_source`, `parse_config`; no file access, so it also runs in the browser playground through `tools/jaifmt/playground.jai`) and the `tools/jaifmt` command line: indentation, operator and comma spacing, brace placement, blank lines and trailing whitespace. It keeps comments, string literals, here-strings and `#asm` bodies, never wraps lines, supports `jaifmt.toml` (indent width, brace style, ignore globs) and `// jaifmt: off` regions, and refuses to write output whose token stream differs from the input. `--check` for CI, `--stdin` for editors.
- `jaic run file.jai -- args` passes `args` to the program (`get_command_line_arguments`).
- Metaprogram plugins: `jaic check|build file.jai -plug Name [plugin options]` (Tracy, Iprof, ...). `Metaprogram_Plugin` gains the newer `init` hook.
- The upstream corpus pins rluba's libraries (jai-tracy, jai-redis, uniform, cluster, jai-csv, jai-postgres, stubborn, hyperserve, wait_group, jai-date) with 15 sweep cases.

### Changed

- The language server binary is now `jailsp` (was `jai-lsp`); update editor configurations that launch it.
- Binary operator precedence follows Jai instead of C: the bitwise and shift operators (`& | ^ << >> <<< >>>`) share one level that binds tighter than `*`, and `%` binds looser than `*` and `/` but tighter than `+` and `-`. `1 << 2 + 3` is now 7, `1 | 2 & 4` is 0, `10 % 3 * 2` is 4 and `b | a << 8` is `(b | a) << 8`. Code written for C's grouping changes meaning silently; the stdlib and tests were parenthesized. See `docs/language/operators.md`.
- A module parameter without a written type (`FRAMES := 3`) stays an untyped constant when the importer passes an untyped number, so it converts to any integer type its value fits, like `FRAMES :: 3`.
- A prefix `cast(T)` / `xx` now takes a following chain of bitwise and shift operators (`& | ^ << >> <<< >>>`) as part of its value, matching Jai: `cast(float) (hex >> 16) & 0xFF` masks before converting, and `cast(u32) byte << 16` shifts the `u8` before widening. Arithmetic, comparisons and logical operators still apply to the cast's result. Code that relied on the old grouping needs `(cast(T) x) << n`; the stdlib and tests were updated.
- `jaifmt` output is canonical, like rustfmt: exactly zero or one space between tokens (binary operators always spaced, no alignment runs, one space before trailing comments, `.{ a, b }` literals), one statement per line, non-empty `{ }` bodies expanded onto their own lines, and a `{` or `else` on its own line always joined to its header (including `if s == "a"`, `if x ==` switches and blank lines in between). Output is idempotent; `tests/native/debug-info` is excluded because the debugger test pins line numbers.

### Fixed

- `#complete` switches report a missing enum case.
- A struct member with an undefined type is an error; the struct silently came out empty. Every declared struct is now laid out, as in Jai.
- Linux arm64 and other system bindings had x86-64 layouts (`stat`, pthread types, `ipc_perm`, signal contexts, `epoll_event` and more), found by the C ABI check.
- `push_allocator(proc, data)` takes effect.
- Crashes and hangs found by fuzzing: deep nesting, nested `#assert(`, oversized types and allocations, constant-folding overflow, `using` pointer cycles, unbounded polymorphic recursion and `#insert` recursion, pointer cycles in `#run` values.
- A top-level `#insert` that builds declarations from a metaprogram-filled `#placeholder` runs once the placeholder is defined (it could be dropped after a failed retry), and a placeholder reached through an import gives way to its definition. Vk-Engine's Editor module checks again.
- `pointer & int`, `pointer | int` and `pointer ^ int` are defined and keep the pointer type (`cast(u64) p & MASK`).
- `cast(bool)` of a number, enum or pointer tests for non-zero; it kept the low byte, so `!cast(bool) 2` was true.
- Arithmetic on an untyped struct literal passed as an argument takes the parameter's type (`f(.{300, -1} * scale)`).
- A `name:` marker in a declaration statement (`ok, shader:, time := f()`) declares every name; it treated the unmarked names as existing variables.
- Uncalled procedures with notes in imported modules are no longer type checked for intercepting metaprograms (only the program's own files are), so Vk-Engine's `Common` module, which has a stale `@PrintLike` procedure, compiles again.
- A struct member's `#align N` now replaces its natural alignment (it could only raise it), so packed C layouts can be reproduced.
- `New` of an `#align 64` type (and any default-allocator or `rpmalloc` block of 64 bytes or more, including `realloc` and array growth) is now 64-byte aligned; it was only 16-aligned, so such objects were misaligned intermittently. Larger alignments are not guaranteed for heap blocks.
- `#align 64` (and larger) locals are aligned in the interpreter too; they were only aligned relative to their stack frame.
- `continue`/`break` in a `for` body inserted by a `for_expansion` run the expansion's loop defers (`defer i += 1;` before `#insert body;` no longer loops forever).
- `null` binds a type variable before a defaulted baked parameter that names it (`is(null)` with `$cmp: (T, T) -> bool = null`).
- `#add_context name :: value;` is a Context constant (`#Context.name`), not a field.
- Unnamed `#library,link_always "x";` statements are linked.
- Integer sentinels cast to procedure types (`SIG_IGN`) are valid constants; the macOS `SIG_*` dispositions have the handler type, as on Linux.
- `Process`: a captured child's stdin is a socket, and `read_pipe` no longer closes a pipe at end of input.
- `String_Builder`: space ensured in the first buffer survives a reset.

### Removed

- The standalone browser playground UI (`web/scripting-runtime`, the CodeMirror editor and its npm dependencies). The hosted playground is at https://matteopolak.com/playground/jai. The browser bundle now holds `jai_wasm.wasm`, `engine.mjs` (moved to `crates/jai-wasm/js/`), `jaifmt-playground.jai`, `build-metadata.json` and a README, and its manifest is schema v2.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

The first release of `jaic`, an independent Jai compiler written in Rust.

### Downloads

| Archive | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `jaic-macos-arm64.tar.gz` | `jaic` with the LLVM backend (check, run, build), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |
| `jaic-linux-x64.tar.gz` | `jaic` with the LLVM backend (check, run, build), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |
| `jaic-windows-x64.zip` | `jaic` without a native backend (check, run), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |

Unpack the archive and run `jaic` from it. It finds the `stdlib/` folder next to the executable (or the folder in `JAIC_STDLIB`). LLVM is linked into the macOS and Linux builds, so it does not need to be installed. Native builds call the system linker: Xcode's command line tools on macOS, `cc` on Linux.

### Compiler

- Type-checks, interprets (`jaic run`) and natively builds (`jaic build`) Jai programs.
- Language: polymorphic procedures and structs, baking, `#modify`, macros, `#code`/`#insert`, custom `for_expansion`, `using`, `context`, `Any` and type info.
- Compile-time execution (`#run`) in the IR interpreter, including calls into native libraries.
- Metaprograms: the `Compiler` module's workspaces, message loop and build options.
- Arithmetic overflow and array bounds checks, stack traces.
- `#asm` for common x86-64 and arm64 instructions.
- `Bindings_Generator` for C, C++ and Objective-C headers, through libclang (loaded at run time when present).

### Standard library

An independently written standard library: `Basic`, `String`, `Hash_Table`, `File`, `Process`, `Thread`, `Math`, `Compiler`, `Bindings_Generator`, `Objective_C`, `GetRect`, `Simp`, `Window_Creation` and more. See `docs/stdlib/` in the repository.

### Tooling

- `jai-lsp`: a language server with diagnostics, type-checked hover and completion, and go to definition.
- A browser playground: the same compiler built for WebAssembly.

### Compatibility

These projects check, run or build: Focus (builds and runs on macOS), Jails, jaison, sgpu, the examples from *The Way to Jai*, and the reference `how_to` programs. Vk-Engine checks for Linux.

### Known limitations

- No native executables for Windows targets yet (no Win64 calling convention). Windows programs can be checked (`-os windows`), and the Windows build of `jaic` checks and interprets.
- No native debug information.
- `#asm` rejects string operations, division, x87 and mask registers.
