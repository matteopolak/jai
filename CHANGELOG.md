# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Native debug information: `jaic build` emits DWARF (a `.dSYM` next to the executable on macOS) with source lines, procedure names and typed locals, parameters and globals, so lldb and gdb can set breakpoints by `file.jai:line`, step and print variables. On by default; `--no-debug-info` or `Build_Options.emit_debug_info = .NONE` turns it off.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

The first release of `jaic`, an independent Jai compiler written in Rust.

### Downloads

| Archive | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `jaic-macos-arm64.tar.gz` | `jaic` with the LLVM backend (check, run, build), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |
| `jaic-linux-x64.tar.gz` | `jaic` with the LLVM backend (check, run, build), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |
| `jaic-windows-x64.zip` | `jaic` without a native backend (check, run), `jai-lsp`, `stdlib/` |

Unpack the archive and run `jaic` from it. It finds the `stdlib/` folder next to the executable (or the folder in `JAIC_STDLIB`). LLVM is linked into the macOS and Linux builds, so it does not need to be installed. Native builds call the system linker: Xcode's command line tools on macOS, `cc` on Linux.

### Compiler

- Type-checks, interprets (`jaic run`) and natively builds (`jaic build`) Jai programs.
- Language: polymorphic procedures and structs, baking, `#modify`, macros, `#code`/`#insert`, custom `for_expansion`, `using`, `context`, `Any` and type info.
- Compile-time execution (`#run`) in the IR interpreter, including calls into native libraries.
- Metaprograms: the `Compiler` module's workspaces, message loop and build options.
- Arithmetic overflow and array bounds checks, stack traces.
- `#asm` for common x86-64 and arm64 instructions.
- `Bindings_Generator` for C, C++ and Objective-C headers, through libclang (loaded at run time when present).

### Standard library

An independently written standard library: `Basic`, `String`, `Hash_Table`, `File`, `Process`, `Thread`, `Math`, `Compiler`, `Bindings_Generator`, `Objective_C`, `GetRect`, `Simp`, `Window_Creation` and more. See `docs/stdlib/` in the repository.

### Tooling

- `jai-lsp`: a language server with diagnostics, type-checked hover and completion, and go to definition.
- A browser playground: the same compiler built for WebAssembly.

### Compatibility

These projects check, run or build: Focus (builds and runs on macOS), Jails, jaison, sgpu, the examples from *The Way to Jai*, and the reference `how_to` programs. Vk-Engine checks for Linux.

### Known limitations

- No native executables for Windows targets yet (no Win64 calling convention). Windows programs can be checked (`-os windows`), and the Windows build of `jaic` checks and interprets.
- No native debug information.
- `#asm` rejects string operations, division, x87 and mask registers.
